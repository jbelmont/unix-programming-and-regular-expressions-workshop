UNIX Operating System from Bell Labs\n\nEarly UNIX systems packed incredible power into very small machines\n\n64 Kb \"virtual\" address space for the code and for data\nThis was often less than that of physical memory on the early PDP-11S\n\n\nSource Code made it easy to experiment and change the system\nAT&T Bell Labs heavily influenced Unix by the likes of Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others\n\nQuote from Dennis Ritchie for Vision of Unix:\n\nWhat we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.\n\n\nUnix Developers were the users of the system and they developed tools to solve their own problems\nUnix Developers were given freedom to experiment and rewrite Unix as needed\nUnix was designed in a quest for elegance\n\nUnix Software Philosophy\nSoftware Tools Book and Software Tools in Pascal\n\nPrograms should be like specialized tools in a carpenter's toolbox\n\nAvoid create programs to rule them all\nDon't create programs that are like a Swiss Army Knife... meaning they do too much\nOne simple example would be sorting... either you can do one of the two following things:\nWrite a bunch of programs to do various tasks, each of which has an option to sort its output\nChoose a common representation for your system (e.g. streams of ASCII text), create a mechanism for composing pieces of the system (Unix pipes), and only write the sorting functionality once\n\n\nA less simple example would be the LLVM compiler (and compilers in general), which uses an intermediate representation (IR) that is understood and operated on by all pieces of the system as the compiler does all the passes required to generate its target (e.g. lexing, parsing, optimization, code generation, etc.)\nIn general, choosing a common representation for a system will turn the problem of interfacing the various pieces from an m*n problem into an m+n problem (where m is the number of different outputs in the first stage, n is number of inputs that are received in the second stage)\n\n\nTools can be combined using pipelines and the shell to get your work done\nOne famous example is Doug McIlroy's word count program, compared to Donald Knuth's, as described here and elsewhere\n\n\nThis philosophy became popular in Kernighan & Plauger Books\nSome example presentations that discuss the Unix philosophy include:\nUnix Pipeline (Brian Kernighan) - Computerphile, which discusses the concept of the Unix pipe\nBringing the Unix Philosophy to Big Data by Bryan Cantrill, which discusses the Unix philosophy in relation to big data\nPycon UK 2016: Python and the Glories of the UNIX Tradition by Brandon Rhodes, which discusses the Unix philosophy in relation to Python\n\n\n\n\n\nDo One thing Well\nPrograms are easier to:\n\nWrite and to correct\n\nDocument\n\nUnderstand and use\n\n\nThe cat command originally only concatenated files\nThe cp command copies files\nThe mv command moves and renames files\n\n\nProcess Lines of Text\nUsing Text as the main data format has advantages:\n\nText is easy to process with existing and new tools\n\nText can be edited with any text editor\n\nText is portable across networks and machine architectures\n\n\nFor example to list some popular baby names and sort them:\ncat data/top-10-baby-names-2016.txt | awk '{print $2 }' | sort\n\nUse Regular Expressions\n\nRegular Expressions provide powerful text matching and substitution\n\n2 Flavors of regular expressions standardized by POSIX\n\nBasic Regular Expressions (BREs)\ngrep, sed, ...\n\n\nExtended Regular Expressions (EREs)\negrep, awk, ...\n\n\n\nDefault to Standard Input/Output\nUse Standard Input/Output (I/O) when there is no files on the command line:\n\nHelps simplify writing programs\nHelps you hook programs together with pipelines\nHelps encourage programs to do one thing well\n\nDon't Be Chatty\n\nStatus messages that are mixed with standard output confuse programs downstream\nIf you ask then you get it. Don't prompt with 'Are you sure'\nDo know what you are doing:\nrm -rf / Before running a command like this\nThis will delete everything starting from the root directory\n\n\nWe have version control systems such as Git use them\n\nMake sure to use the input format for output\n\nIf your text is structured then after processing\nWrite the same format for standard output in the same format of standard input\nDoing this affords you to build specialized tools that work together\n\n\n\nWrite specialized tools if they do not exist\n\nAt times a tool does not exist, that is when you need to write the tool\nCan the tool be useful to other people?\nCan the tool be generalized?\n\n\n\nIf any of the answers to these questions are yes:\n\nthen write a general purpose tool\n\n\nScripting languages can often be used to write a software tool:\n\nAwk\nPerl\nPython\nRuby\nShell\n\n\nYou can also use other languages like for example Golang as we will see\n\n\nSoftware Tools Summary\n\nUsing the software tools approach helps provide a framework and a mindset for programming and scripting\nYou can combine software tools to solve software programs\nThis strategy in turn gives you flexibility and helps promote innovation\n\n\nKnow your tools and thinking in the Software Tools Philosophy will improve your scripting\n\nSelf Contained Shell Scripts\nExecutable Definition\n\nIn computing, executable code or an executable file or executable program, sometimes simply referred to as an executable or binary, causes a computer \"to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions,\"[1] as opposed to a data file that must be parsed by a program to be meaningful.\n\nTypically a high level language is used that compiles to executable machine code files\n\nExecutable scripts typicall start with a Shebang => #! /bin/bash or the like\nAn optional argument can be provided\nSome Unix systems have small limits on the path name length\n\n\n\nShell Scripts can be simple executable text files that contain shell commands.\n\nKeep in mind that this only works if the shell script is in the same language as the interactive shell\nFor example to expect a zsh shell script to run in a bash environment\n\n\n\n"},"docs/basics-of-shell-programming.html":{"url":"docs/basics-of-shell-programming.html","title":"Basics of Shell

./scripts/basics-of-shell-programming/compare-positional-parameters.sh\nArgs using $@\none\ntwo three\nfour\nArgs using $*\none two three four\n\nNotice that the $@ treated each argument that was quoted as separate while $* treated them as one argument\nAlways use double quotes when referring to variable values\nAlways use \"$*\" to refer to all command line arguments in these scenarios:\n\nProcessing arguments in a loop\nPassing arguments onto another command\n\nQuoting\n$ one=one\n$ echo $one\none\n$ echo \\$one\n$one\n\nNotice above that the backslash made echo \\$one a literal argument\n$ first_name=marcel\n$ last_name=belmont\n$ echo '$first_name $last_name'\n$first_name $last_name\n$ echo \"$first_name $last_name\"\nmarcel belmont\n$ name=\"$first_name $last_name\"\n$ echo \"My name is $name\"\nMy name is marcel belmont\n\nNotice that the variables in single quotes were treated literally while the double quotes were evaluated\nExecution Tracing\nDebugging in Bash\nExecution tracing is the main way to conduct debugging in the shell\n$ set -x\n$ echo $name\n+ echo Jean-Marcel\nJean-Marcel\n$ set +x\n+ set +x\n$ echo $name\nJean-Marcel\n\nNotice that set -x turned on execution tracing while set +x turned it off again\nRun the script ./scripts/basics-of-shell-programming/script-tracing.sh\n$ ./scripts/basics-of-shell-programming/script-tracing.sh one two three\n+ for arg in '\"$@\"'\n+ printf 'This arg is one\\n'\nThis arg is one\n+ for arg in '\"$@\"'\n+ printf 'This arg is two\\n'\nThis arg is two\n+ for arg in '\"$@\"'\n+ printf 'This arg is three\\n'\nThis arg is three\n\nNotice here that we turned on execution tracing in the shebang line with optional argument\nEach line traced each step of the script, notice that the script ran 3 times\n\nBackslash \\ will quote the following single character\nSingle Quotes are treated literally\nNo need to escape and single quotes don't do expansion\nNeed to escape embedded single quotes in single quotes\necho 'one '\\''two'\\''' => one 'two'\n\n\n\n\nDouble quotes do some expansions\nUse \\ inside \"...\" to escape the following characters:\n\"\n$\n`\n\n\n\n\nExecution Tracing helps you understand what the shell is doing on each step\n\nBest Practice for Quoting\n\nQuote text that are passed to commands\nDouble quote is almost always what you want to do\n\n\nMake sure to understand what double quote do\nExecution Tracing is the most important form of debugging in the shell\nThere is a bash debugger as well\n\n\nBash quotes arguments with metacharacters\n\nRedirection\nRedirection\n$ cat\none\none\ntwo\ntwo\nthree\nthree\n\nHere I entered cat pressed enter then typed one and hit enter and standard output printed another one to standard output and the last three printed to standard output I pressed control d\n$ cat > colors.txt\n## Hit enter\nblue\ngreen\norange\nblack\nyellow\n## Press Control D for end of line\n\n$ cat colors.txt\nblue\ngreen\norange\nblack\nyellow\n\nNotice that we used cat and redirected the output of standard input into the file called colors.txt\n$ cat >> colors.txt\nwhite\nbash-4.4$ cat colors.txt\nblue\ngreen\norange\nblack\nyellow\nwhite\n\nNotice here that the >> operator appended elements to a file\n$ echo \"one\n> two\n> three\n> \" > numbers.txt\n\n$ cat numbers.txt\none\ntwo\nthree\n\n$ echo \"four\n> five\n> six\" > numbers2.txt\n\n$ cat numbers.txt numbers2.txt > allnumbers.txt\n\n$ cat allnumbers.txt\none\ntwo\nthree\nfour\nfive\nsix\n\n\nNotice in this shell execution we created 2 files called numbers.txt and numbers2.txt using echo command\nThen we created another file called allnumbers.txt using > redirection operator\n\n$ tr a-z A-Z  one\n> two\n> three\n> UPPER\nONE\nTWO\nTHREE\n\nNotice the tr operator which translate characters and the  operator is known as a here document\nWhen you use the  operator (here document) you need to define a literal value to delimit in this case we used UPPER\nHere Document\n$ tr a-z A-Z \nNotice that here we use  which is known as here string\nHere strings\n$ od -c allnumbers.txt\n0000000    o   n   e  \\n   t   w   o  \\n   t   h   r   e   e  \\n   f   o\n0000020    u   r  \\n   f   i   v   e  \\n   s   i   x  \\n\n0000034\n\nNotice here we used the od -- octal, decimal, hex, ASCII dump operator with -c flag to output c-style escaped characters\nDifferences with Redirection Operators\n\n is used to redirect input\n> is used to redirect output.\n>> is used to append output\n is used to read from a stream literal and behaves like a file\n is used to read a stream from a word\n| is used to feed standard output of one command as standard input for another command\n\nOther operators used in shell redirection\nTLDP Shell Redirection\n\n1> filename\n\nRedirect stdout to file \"filename.\"\n\n\n1>> filename\n\nRedirect and append stdout to file \"filename.\"\n\n\n2> filename\n\nRedirect stderr to file \"filename.\"\n\n\n2>> filename\n\nRedirect and append stderr to file \"filename.\"\n\n\n&> filename\n\nRedirect both stdout and stderr to file \"filename.\"\nThis operator is now functional, as of Bash 4, final release.\n\n\n2>&1\n\nRedirects stderr to stdout.\nError messages get sent to same place as standard output.\n\n\nfilename 2>&1\n\nbad_command >>filename 2>&1\nAppends both stdout and stderr to the file \"filename\" ...\n2>&1 | [command(s)]\nbad_command 2>&1 | awk '{print $5}'   # found\nSends stderr through a pipe.\n|& was added to Bash 4 as an abbreviation for 2>&1 |.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni>&j\n\nRedirects file descriptor i to j.\nAll output of file pointed to by i gets sent to file pointed to by j.\n\n\n\n&j\n\nRedirects, by default, file descriptor 1 (stdout) to j.\nAll stdout gets sent to file pointed to by j.\n\n\n\n\nHere is a hello world example in the C programming Language with a syntax error\n#include \n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n  printf(\"hello World\\n\")\n  return 0;\n}\n\n$ make helloWorld\ncc     helloWorld.c   -o helloWorld\nhelloWorld.c:4:26: error: expected ';' after expression\n  printf(\"hello World\\n\")\n                         ^\n                         ;\n1 error generated.\nmake: *** [helloWorld] Error 1\n\nHere we use the Make utility which is a build automation tool to build executable programs\nWhen we run make helloWorld we get both standard output and standard error all printed in screen\n$ make helloWorld > helloWorld.out 2> helloWorld.err\n$ cat helloWorld.err\nhelloWorld.c:4:26: error: expected ';' after expression\n  printf(\"hello World\\n\")\n                         ^\n                         ;\n1 error generated.\nmake: *** [helloWorld] Error 1\n$ cat helloWorld.out\ncc     helloWorld.c   -o helloWorld\n\nNotice here we used > to redirect standard output  and 2> to redirect standard error\nOne important point is that you must redirect standard output before redirecting standard error\n$ make helloWorld 2>&1 | tee errors\n\nNotice here used 2>&1 to redirect stderr to stdout and then used the TEE command)\n\nThe tee utility copies standard input to standard output, making a copy in zero or more files.\nThe output is unbuffered.\n\n\n\n$ make helloWorld > helloWorld.out 2>&1\n\nThis command redirects standard output and standard error to a file called helloWorld.out\nPipe Operator\n✗ echo 'one two three' | tr a-z A-Z\nONE TWO THREE\n\nThe | operator used the standard output of echo to feed the tr operator and transform characters to uppercase\nPipelines in Unix\n\nIn Unix-like computer operating systems, a pipeline is a sequence of processes chained together by their standard streams, so that the output of each process (stdout) feeds directly as input (stdin) to the next one.\n\nGood Practices in Shell Redirection\n\nRead the Fine Manual (RTFM) as necessary using man command\nCapture standard error as necessary\nThrow away standard output if you don't need it\nRedirection with , >, , , | are fundamental operators to use\nRedirecting standard error with 2>... is both powerful and useful\n\nRedirecting standard error in 3 ways:\n\nmake helloWorld > helloWorld.out 2> helloWorld.err\nThis format creates 2 separate files with > funneling standard output into a file\nand 2> funneling standard error into a file\n\n\nmake helloWorld > helloWorld.out 2>&1\nThis command sends stdout and stderr both to helloWorld.out\n\n\nmake helloWorld 2>&1 | tee helloWorld.out\nThis command uses tee to both send stdout and stderr to console and create file called helloWorld.out\n\n\n\nRedirect to /dev/null\n$ cat /etc/passwd > /dev/null\n$ echo $?\n0\n\nIn this run we threw away standard output into /dev/null and then checked exit status with $? and it ran successfully\n\nRead more about devices directory in The /dev directory\n\nCommand Types and Searching\nType Operator\nShell Builtins\nShell Builtin\n\nIn computing, a shell builtin is a command or a function, called from a shell, that is executed directly in the shell itself, instead of an external executable program which the shell would load and execute.\n\n$ type echo\necho is a shell builtin\n\n$ type type\ntype is a shell builtin\n\nNotice here that type is used to tell what type of command we have\nShell Functions\n$ type cp\ncp is /bin/cp\n\ncp is a shell function\nShell Aliases\nShell Aliases\n\nIn computing, alias is a command in various command line interpreters (shells) such as Unix shells, 4DOS/4NT and Windows PowerShell, which enables a replacement of a word by another string. It is mainly used for abbreviating a system command, or for adding default arguments to a regularly used command. Aliasing functionality in the MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems is provided by the DOSKey command-line utility.\n\n✗ alias\n-='cd -'\n...=../..\n....=../../..\n.....=../../../..\n......=../../../../..\n1='cd -'\n2='cd -2'\n3='cd -3'\n4='cd -4'\n5='cd -5'\n6='cd -6'\n7='cd -7'\n8='cd -8'\n9='cd -9'\n_=sudo\nafind='ack -il'\nbaidu='web_search baidu'\nbing='web_search bing'\nbrews='brew list -1'\nbubc='brew upgrade && brew cleanup'\nbubo='brew update && brew outdated'\nbubu='bubo && bubc'\nd='dirs -v | head -10'\ndcb='docker-compose build'\ndcdn='docker-compose down'\ndce='docker-compose exec'\ndcl='docker-compose logs'\ndclf='docker-compose logs -f'\ndco=docker-compose\ndcps='docker-compose ps'\ndcr='docker-compose run'\ndcrestart='docker-compose restart'\ndcrm='docker-compose rm'\ndcstop='docker-compose stop'\n...\n\nNotice here that aliases are used to make abbreviated commands\nHashed commands\n$ ls\nLICENSE                _book                docs                package.json\nREADME.md            book.json            node_modules            scripts\nSUMMARY.md            data                npm-debug.log.4075885730\n$ man bash\n$ hash\nhits    command\n   1    /usr/bin/man\n   1    /bin/ls\n\nShell Keywords\n\nA keyword is a reserved word, token or operator. Keywords have a special meaning to the shell, and indeed are the building blocks of the shell's syntax. As examples, for, while, do, and ! are keywords. Similar to a builtin, a keyword is hard-coded into Bash, but unlike a builtin, a keyword is not in itself a command, but a subunit of a command construct.\n\n$ type [\n[ is a shell builtin\n$ type [[\n[[ is a shell keyword\n\nWe will go over these later in the workshop\nShell Documentation for Builtins\nIn bash use help to get documentation for shell builtins\n$ help echo\necho: echo [-neE] [arg ...]\n    Write arguments to the standard output.\n\n    Display the ARGs, separated by a single space character and followed by a\n    newline, on the standard output.\n\n    Options:\n      -n    do not append a newline\n      -e    enable interpretation of the following backslash escapes\n      -E    explicitly suppress interpretation of backslash escapes\n\n    `echo' interprets the following backslash-escaped characters:\n      \\a    alert (bell)\n      \\b    backspace\n      \\c    suppress further output\n      \\e    escape character\n      \\E    escape character\n      \\f    form feed\n      \\n    new line\n      \\r    carriage return\n      \\t    horizontal tab\n      \\v    vertical tab\n      \\\\    backslash\n      \\0nnn    the character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).  NNN can be\n            0 to 3 octal digits\n      \\xHH    the eight-bit character whose value is HH (hexadecimal).  HH\n            can be one or two hex digits\n\n    Exit Status:\n    Returns success unless a write error occurs.\n\nwhile in Zsh you need to use run-help to get shell builtin documentation\n$ run-help echo\n## Pager is used in my case it is LESS\necho [ -neE ] [ arg ... ]\n       Write  each  arg on the standard output, with a space separating\n       each one.  If the -n flag is not present, print a newline at the\n       end.  echo recognizes the following escape sequences:\n\n       \\a     bell character\n       \\b     backspace\n       \\c     suppress final newline\n       \\e     escape\n       \\f     form feed\n       \\n     linefeed (newline)\n       \\r     carriage return\n       \\t     horizontal tab\n       \\v     vertical tab\n       \\\\     backslash\n       \\0NNN  character code in octal\n       \\xNN   character code in hexadecimal\n       \\uNNNN unicode character code in hexadecimal\n       \\UNNNNNNNN\n              unicode character code in hexadecimal\n\n       The  -E  flag,  or  the  BSD_ECHO option, can be used to disable\n       these escape sequences.  In the latter case, -e flag can be used\n       to enable them.\n/Users/marcelbelmont/zsh_help/echo (END)\n\nCommand Builtin\nCommand is used when you want to enhance a regular builtin command and what to use shell functions\nIn this script below although we really didn't enhance echo command is a sample script using command builtin\ndifferent-type-of-echo.sh:\n#! /bin/bash -\n\ntype echo\necho \"defining echo command\"\n\nfunction echo () {\n  command echo \"$@\"\n  printf \"Printing some commands here\\n\"\n}\n\ntype echo\n\necho \"one two three\"\n\nRunning the script above:\necho is a shell builtin\ndefining echo command\necho is a function\necho ()\n{\n    command echo \"$@\";\n    printf \"Printing some commands here\\n\"\n}\none two three\nPrinting some commands here\n\nNotice that at first echo is a shell builtin and then with the command builtin we are using our own version of echo\nSpecial Builtins\nBash Special Builtins\nFor historical reasons, the POSIX standard has classified several builtin commands as special. When Bash is executing in POSIX mode, the special builtins differ from other builtin commands in three respects:\nSpecial builtins are found before shell functions during command lookup.\nIf a special builtin returns an error status, a non-interactive shell exits.\nAssignment statements preceding the command stay in effect in the shell environment after the command completes.\nWhen Bash is not executing in POSIX mode, these builtins behave no differently than the rest of the Bash builtin commands. The Bash POSIX mode is described in Bash POSIX Mode.\nThese are the POSIX special builtins:\nbreak : . continue eval exec exit export readonly return set\nshift trap unset\nI am not sure whether zsh calls break and continue special builtins\nDefining your own scripts\nThe PATH variable is used find location of binary executables\n\nOn POSIX and Unix-like operating systems, the $PATH variable is specified as a list of one or more directory names separated by colon (:) characters.\n\nPath Variable\necho $PATH\n/Users/marcelbelmont/.gvm/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.nvm/versions/node/v6.11.2/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.local/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin:/usr/local/opt/openvpn/sbin:/Users/marcelbelmont/go/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.gvm/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.local/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin:/usr/local/opt/openvpn/sbin:/Users/marcelbelmont/go/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.gvm/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.local/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:...\n\nNotice that when we echo the contents of PATH variable the local executables come first\nexport PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin:$(brew --prefix openvpn)/sbin:$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\nHere is my local PATH variable\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin\"\n\nHere rvm is prepended to existing PATH variable\nGood Practices for PATH variable:\n\nYou should use a convention like $HOME:/bin to define any local scripts\nDon't use current directory as this can be used to execute malicious code like a trojan horse\nBe careful with PATH variable\nUse full paths only\nDon't use empty elements or explicit . in PATH variable\n\n\nTry to put private directories first\nUse command function to skip functions\nClear CDPATH in production environments\n\nCDPATH variable\n\nUse CDPATH to define the base directory for cd command\nNever export CDPATH from your shell to the environment.\nIf you use CDPATH then set it in your .bashrc, .zshrc file and don’t export it\nso that it’s only set in interactive shells.\n\n\n\nCDPATH=~/genesys:.\n\nNow when I try cd into directory I can cd into any folders inside of ~/genesys and it will be found\nAs I mentioned above don't do this in production because there is assumptions about directory structure here that won't necessarily be the case in a production environment\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← README\nIntroduction to Text Processing →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/introduction-to-text-processing.html":{"url":"docs/introduction-to-text-processing.html","title":"Introduction to Text Processing","keywords":"","body":"Unix Programming and Regular Expressions Workshop - Introduction to Text Processing\nSections:\n\nCounting lines, words, and characters\nTransforming Text\nTabs vs Spaces\nText extraction\nComparing Sorted Files\nScript using tr, sort, and comm\nBest Practices\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nCounting lines, words, and characters\n\nwc command, short for word count\nThe wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file\nor standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output.\nA line is defined as a string of characters delimited by a  character.\nCharacters beyond the final  character will not be included in the line count.\n\n\nOutput order: count of lines, words, characters, or bytes\nDefault count is lines, words, bytes\nCharacters can be multibyte encoded\n\n\n\nwc takes the following output:\n\n-c The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard output.  This will cancel out any prior usage of the -m option.\n-l The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard output.\n-m The number of characters in each input file is written to the standard output.\nIf the current locale does not support multibyte characters, this is equivalent to the -c option.\nThis will cancel out any prior usage of the -c option.\n\n\n-w The number of words in each input file is written to the standard output.\n\nTransforming Text\n\ntr command, short for translate characters\nThe tr utility copies the standard input to the standard output with substitution or deletion of selected characters\nThe tr command transforms text\nThe following options are available for tr:\n-C Complement the set of characters in string1, that is `-C ab'' includes every character except fora' and `b'.\n-c Same as -C but complement the set of values in string1.\n-d Delete characters in string1 from the input.\n-s Squeeze multiple occurrences of the characters listed in the last operand (either string1 or string2) in the input into a single instance of the character.\nThis occurs after all deletion and translation is completed.\n\n\n-u Guarantee that any output is unbuffered.\n\n\n\nTypical usage for tr is to map one set of values into another:\n\ntr a-z A-Z is old style\ntr [:lower:] [:upper:] is POSIX style\n\n[:class:] Represents all characters belonging to the defined character class.\nClass names are:\n\nalnum        \nalpha        \nblank        \ncntrl        \ndigit        \ngraph        \nideogram     \nlower        \nphonogram

named files or the standard input writing the standard output with tabs changed into blanks.\nBackspace characters are preserved into the output and decrement the column count for tab calculations.\nThe expand utility is useful for pre-processing character files (before sorting, looking at specific columns, etc.) that contain tabs.\nunexpand command converts spaces to tabs\nThe unexpand utility puts tabs back into the data from the standard input or the named files and writes the result on the standard output.\n\nThe following options are available for both expand and unexpand:\n\n-a (unexpand only.)\nBy default, only leading blanks and tabs are reconverted to maximal strings of tabs.\nIf the -a option is given, then tabs are inserted whenever they would compress the resultant file by replacing two or more characters.\n-t tab1,tab2,...,tabn\nSet tab stops at column positions tab1, tab2, ..., tabn.\nIf only a single number is given, tab stops are set that number of column positions apart instead of the default number of 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nod -c\none two three   4 five  six\n0000000    o   n   e       t   w   o       t   h   r   e   e  \\t   4\n0000020    f

\\n\n0000014\n\nHere when I use BSD expand/unexpand I had to explicitly set -t flag\nText extraction\n\ntail command prints N lines (10 by default)\nThe tail utility displays the contents of file or, by default, its standard input, to the standard output.\n\nThe options for tail are as follows:\n\n-b number The location is number 512-byte blocks.\n-c number The location is number bytes.\n-f The -f option causes tail to not stop when end of file is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input.\nThe -f option is ignored if the standard input is a pipe, but not if it is a FIFO.\n\n\n-F The -F option implies the -f option, but tail will also check to see if the file being followed has been renamed or rotated.\nThe file is closed and reopened when tail detects that the filename being read from has a new inode number.\nThe -F option is ignored if reading from standard input rather than a file.\n-n number The location is number lines.\n-q Suppresses printing of headers when multiple files are being examined.\n-r The -r option causes the input to be displayed in reverse order, by line.\n\n\n\nRead the Fine Manual for more options\nComparing Sorted Files\n\ncomm command compares two sorted files\nThe comm utility reads file1 and file2, which should be sorted lexically, and produces three text columns as output: lines only in file1; lines only in file2; and lines in both files\nThe filename - means the standard input (stdin)\n\nThe following options for comm are available:\n\n-1    Suppress printing of column 1.\n-2    Suppress printing of column 2.\n-3    Suppress printing of column 3.\n-i    Case insensitive comparison of lines.\n\nScript using tr, sort, and comm\n./scripts/introduction-to-text-processing/spell_checking.sh\n\ncont\ndat\nspele\nsumetimes\n\nNotice this script printed out the misspelled words from the text file into the screen\n./scripts/introduction-to-text-processing/spell_checking_success.sh\n\nNotice no words were printed out\nStep by step execution of the script:\n\ntr '[:space:][:punct:]' '\\n' \ntr transforms spaces and punctuation characters to a new line\n\n\ntr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' via pipeline tr transforms any Uppercase characters to lowercase\nsort -u via another pipeline we sort the text and show only unique entries\ncomm -23 - /usr/share/dict/words via the last pipeline we pass into the comm command the standard input and compare it to entries in /usr/share/dict/words\nRemember that the comm file needs to have input sorted and column 1 is content only in 1\nThe second column is content only in file 2\nThe third column is content only in both\nWe only want the content from standard input or column 1\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nUse POSIX options instead for portability\nUtilities that work with character sets (tr) and with sorted files (comm) are sensitive to current locale\n\nCharacter sets can vary wildly in different locales\nSimilarly files sort differently in different locales\n\n\nIf you use export LC_ALL=C you will get a traditional Unix environment\n\nTo be safe re-sort files in the current locale if the files were sorted in a different locale\nTry to utilize the power of sorting and regular expressions\nUse tr for letter case transformations and to break lines into one word per line\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Basics of Shell Programming\nText Searching

expressions (regex) can be thought of as a language to describe matching text.\n\nA regular expression, regex or regexp (sometimes called a rational expression) is, in theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.\n\nRegular Expressions are comprised of:\n\nSome regular characters that can stand for themselves like 'a'\nMetacharacters that can stand for a regular expression operation\n\nHere is a chart on metacharacters:\n\n\n\nMetacharacter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n^\nMatches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.\n\n\n.\nMatches any single character (many applications exclude newlines, and exactly which characters are considered newlines is flavor-, character-encoding-, and platform-specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character matches a literal dot. For example, a.c matches \"abc\", etc., but [a.c] matches only \"a\", \".\", or \"c\".\n\n\n[]\nA bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, [abc] matches \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". [a-z] specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". These forms can be mixed: [abcx-z] matches \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"x\", \"y\", or \"z\", as does [a-cx-z]. The - character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the ^, if present) character within the brackets: [abc-], [-abc]. Note that backslash escapes are not allowed. The ] character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the ^) character: []abc].\n\n\n[^]\nMatches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, abc matches any character other than \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". a-z matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". Likewise, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.\n\n\n$\nMatches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line.\n\n\n()\nDefines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, \\n). A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group. BRE mode requires ( ).\n\n\n\\n\nMatches what the nth marked subexpression matched, where n is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is vaguely defined in the POSIX.2 standard. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups.\n\n\n*\nMatches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, abc matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbbc\", etc. [xyz] matches \"\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"zx\", \"zyx\", \"xyzzy\", and so on. (ab)* matches \"\", \"ab\", \"abab\", \"ababab\", and so on.\n\n\n{m, n}\nMatches the preceding element at least m and not more than n times. For example, a{3,5} matches only \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", and \"aaaaa\". This is not found in a few older instances of regexes. BRE mode requires {m,n}.\n\n\n\n\nExpressions that denote categories of a regular expression\n\nHistory and Types of Regular Expressions\n\nRegular expressions originated in 1956, when mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described regular languages using his mathematical notation called regular sets. These arose in theoretical computer science, in the subfields of automata theory (models of computation) and the description and classification of formal languages. Other early implementations of pattern matching include the SNOBOL language, which did not use regular expressions, but instead its own pattern matching constructs.\n\n\nDifferent Unix tools have used different Regular Expression types\nThis reflects the influence and interests in AT&T Research Labs (Kernighan, Ritchie, etc)\n\nUnix Tools that use Regular Expressions\nUnix Tools that use Regexes:\n\ngrep\n\nsed\n\nawk\n\nvim\n\nemacs\n\n\nBasic Regular Expressions\nBRE (Basic Regular Expressions)\nBRE . Although POSIX.2 leaves some implementation specifics undefined, BRE and ERE provide a \"standard\" which has since been adopted as the default syntax of many tools, where the choice of BRE or ERE modes is usually a supported option. For example, GNU grep has the following options: \"grep -E\" for ERE, and \"grep -G\" for BRE (the default), and \"grep -P\" for Perl regexes.\nExamples of Regular Expressions\nHere are some examples from the Regular Expressions Wikipedia Page:\n\n.at matches any three-character string ending with \"at\", including \"hat\", \"cat\", and \"bat\".\n\n[hc]at matches \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n\n[^b]at matches all strings matched by .at except \"bat\".\n\n[^hc]at matches all strings matched by .at other than \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n\n^[hc]at matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the beginning of the string or line.\n\n[hc]at$ matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the end of the string or line.\n\n\\[.\\] matches any single character surrounded by \"[\" and \"]\" since the brackets are escaped, for example: \"[a]\" and \"[b]\".\n\ns.* matches s followed by zero or more characters, for example: \"s\" and \"saw\" and \"seed\".\n\n\nExtended Regular Expressions\n\nERE (Extended Regular Expressions) adds ?, +, and |, and EREs removes the need to escape the metacharacters ( ) and { }, which are required in BREs.\n\nFurthermore, as long as the POSIX standard syntax for regexes is adhered to, there can be, and often is, additional syntax to serve specific (yet POSIX compliant) applications\n\nThe meaning of metacharacters escaped with a backslash is reversed for some characters in the POSIX Extended Regular Expression (ERE) syntax.\n\nWith this syntax, a backslash causes the metacharacter to be treated as a literal character.\n\nSo, for example, \\( \\) is now ( ) and \\{ \\} is now { }.\n\nAdditionally, support is removed for \\n backreferences and the following metacharacters are added:\n\n\n\n\n\nMetacharacter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n?\nMatches the preceding element zero or one time. For example, ab?c matches only \"ac\" or \"abc\".\n\n\n+\nMatches the preceding element one or more times. For example, ab+c matches \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on, but not \"ac\".\n\n\n|\nThe choice (also known as alternation or set union) operator matches either the expression before or the expression after the operator. For example, abc|def matches \"abc\" or \"def\".\n\n\n\nExamples of EREs\n\n[hc]?at matches \"hat\", \"cat\", and \"at\".\n\n[hc]*at matches \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", \"at\", and so on.\n\n[hc]+at matches \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", and so on, but not \"at\".\n\ncat|dog matches \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n\n\nFamily of Regular Expression Tools\nGrep\nDifferent Grep programs:\n\nThe grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match one or more patterns.\nThe egrep interprets pattern as an extended regular expression\nForce regular grep to behave like egrep with -E flag.\n\n\nThe fgrep interprets pattern as a set of fixed strings.\nForce regular grep to behave as fgrep with -F.\n\n\nThe zgrep invokes grep on compressed or gzipped files\nForce regular grep to behave as zgrep with -Z.\n\n\nThe zegrep accept input files compressed with the compress utility\nThe zfgrep compression utilities with gzip\n\nSed\n\nSed is good for text matching and substitution\n\nThe sed utility reads the specified files, or the standard input if no files are specified, modifying the input as specified by a list of commands.\n\nThe input is then written to the standard output\n\n\nAwk\n\nPattern matching with an actual programming language\n\nAwk scans each input file for lines that match any of a set of patterns specified literally in prog or in one or more files specified as -f progfile.\n\nWith each pattern there can be an associated action that will be performed when a line of a file matches the  pattern.\n\nEach line is matched against the pattern portion of every pattern-action statement; the associated action is performed for each matched pattern.\n\nThe file name - means the standard input.\n\nAny file of the form var=value is treated as an assignment, not a filename, and is executed  at the time it would have been opened if it were a filename.\n\nThe option -v followed by var=value is an assignment to be done before prog is executed; any number of -v options may be present.\n\nThe -F fs option defines the input field separator to be the regular expression fs.\n\n\nScripting Languages with Regular Expression Flavors of their own\n\nPerl\nPython\nRuby\nJavaScript\n\nImportant Grep Options\nList of Imporant grep options:\n\n-e specify a pattern used during the search of the input: an input line is selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.\n\nThis option is most useful when multiple -e options are used to specify multiple patterns, or when a pattern begins with a dash (`-').\n\n\n-f Read one or more newline separated patterns from file.\n\nEmpty pattern lines match every input line.\nNewlines are not considered part of a pattern.\nIf file is empty, nothing is matched.\n\n\n-l Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to standard output.  grep will only search a file until a match has been found, making searches potentially less expensive.\n\nPathnames are listed once per file searched.\nIf the standard input is searched, the string ``(standard input)'' is written.\n\n\n-v Selected lines are those not matching any of the specified patterns (invert matches)\n\n-q suppress output or quiet mode\n\nOften in a shell script doing > /dev/null is more obvious to readers\n\n\n-s don't print errors\n\n\nGood Practices for Regular Expressions\n\nTry to use EREs as much as you can as their more powerful and modern machines have the capability to run them with too much performance impact.\n\nAlways quote your Regular Expressions\n\n\nSingle Character Expressions\n\nRegular characters like \"Z\" or \"&\" match themselves\n\nCharacter case matters: \"d\" and \"D\" are different\n\nPeriod (\".\") matches any single character\n\nPossibly matches newlines\n\n\n\nEscaped metacharacter:\n\n\\. matches a real period\n\\\\ matches a real backslash\n\nBracket Expressions\n\nThe brackets [ ] match any one character\nSo [abcde] matches one of the characters a, b, c, d, e respectively\nUsing a dash like this [0-9] or [A-Z] matches all characters in alphabet or numbers 0 through 9 respectively\nUsing a caret ^ in the beginning of bracket will invert matches [^cd] will match anything not c or d\n\nCharacter classes are used for digits, punctuations, letters, etc..\n\n[[:classname:]] notice the inner bracket [:classname:]\n\nCharacter Classes:\n\n'[:alnum:]'\n\nAlphanumeric characters: '[:alpha:]' and '[:digit:]'; in the 'C' locale and ASCII character encoding, this is the same as ‘[0-9A-Za-z]’.\n\n\n'[:alpha:]'\n\nAlphabetic characters: '[:lower:]' and '[:upper:]'; in the 'C' locale and ASCII character encoding, this is the same as '[A-Za-z]'.\n\n\n'[:blank:]'\n\nBlank characters: space and tab.\n\n\n'[:cntrl:]'\n\nControl characters. In ASCII, these characters have octal codes 000 through 037, and 177 (DEL).\nIn other character sets, these are the equivalent characters, if any.\n\n\n'[:digit:]'\n\nDigits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.\n\n\n'[:graph:]'\n\nGraphical characters: '[:alnum:]' and '[:punct:]'.\n\n\n'[:lower:]'\n\nLower-case letters; in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII character encoding, this is a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.\n\n\n'[:print:]'\n\nPrintable characters: '[:alnum:]', '[:punct:]', and space.\n\n\n'[:punct:]'\n\nPunctuation characters; in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII character encoding, this is ! \" # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ;  ? @ [ \\ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~.\n\n\n'[:space:]'\n\nSpace characters: in the ‘C’ locale, this is tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, and space.\n\n\n'[:upper:]'\n\nUpper-case letters: in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII character encoding, this is A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.\n\n\n'[:xdigit:]'\n\nHexadecimal digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f.\n\n\n\nRepetition in Grep\n\nAsterisk (*) indicates zero or more of the preceding character\nbc*d matches bd, bcd, bccd, bcccd, ...\n\n\nNotice the * matches zero or more the c characters\nit does not match bAd though it only matches with c characters\n.* matches any character though so it is most powerful match\n* matches the null string as well which can affect substitutions\n\nBasic Grep Examples\n$ echo 'Hey Marcel how are you doing?' | grep --color 'Marcel'\n\nNotice when you output this that Marcel is in color because it is a match\n$ echo 'Hey Marcel how are you doing?' | grep --color 'marcel'\n\nThis will not match though because case matters\n$ echo 'You are hungry right?' | grep --color h.ngry\n\nNotice that hungry matches because the dot . matches any character\n$ echo this is www.marcelbelmont.com domain | grep --color 'www\\.marcelbelmont\\.com'\n\nWhen you want to match a literal character such as a dot it needs to be escaped\n$ echo abc 555 | grep --color '[aeiouc]'\n\nWhat do you think will match here?\n$ echo what will match here 987 | grep --color '[^whe9]'\n\nWhat matches here?\n$ echo what is happening 587-987-1000 | grep --color '[[:digit:]]'\n\nThis matches numbers 0-9\n$ echo what should match here? 897-888-3333 | grep --color '[^[:digit:]]'\n\nWhat matches here?\necho do alphas match? 5899 | grep --color '[[:alpha:]]'\n\nThe alpha character class matches any characters in alphabet\necho do alphas match? 5899 | grep --color '[^[:alpha:]]'\n\nWhat should match here?\n$ echo what matches here 888 | grep --color '[[:alpha:]]*'\n\n$ echo 0899 matches here 888 | grep --color '[[:alpha:]]*'\n\n$ echo 159 out for this 999 | ggrep -E --color '[^[:alpha:]]*'\n\n$ echo what the 189 stuff 877 | grep --color -E '[[:digit:]]*'\n\n$ echo what the 189 stuff 877 | grep --color -E '[^[:digit:]]*'\n\nWhen using bsd grep there is what seems like subtle bugs\nI have gnu grep installed and all occurrences of  characters not in alphabet matched as they should\n\nBe aware of subtle differences between BSD Unix Tools and GNU they creep up on you.\n\nUsing --color and some sample data helps test your BREs as you write them\n\n\nInterval Expressions\n\nd\\{A\\} - A occurrences of d\nd\\{A,\\} - At least A occurrences of d\nd\\{A, B\\} - A to B occurrences of d\n\nThe d means a single character\n\n[[:digit:]]\\{3\\}-[[:digit:]]\\{4\\} this RegEx matches on a US local phone number\n\nsuch as 531-2000\n\n\nA and B are integers up to RE_DUP_MAX\n\n\nIf you are on a Mac run the following command:\n$ sysctl user.re_dup_max\nuser.re_dup_max: 255\n\nsysctl can print kernel state variables\nAnchor regex matches\n\nCaret ^ means match must start at beginning of line or string\n\nDollar Sign $ means match must occur at end of line or string\n\nif you use ^ and $ in the middle of a basic regular expression than they stand for their literal value\n\n\nParenthesized Subexpressions\n\n(o[pq])(567)yy\\2\\1 is the same as `o[pq]567yyY2Y1\n\nThe Y2 and Yq are the actual text that match expressions in parentheses\nThe contents of the parenthesis can be any regular expression\n\n\nYou can use up to 9 parenthesized subexpressions\nThis is often called \"backreferences\"\nThis only works for Basic Regular Expressions (BREs)\n\nBasic Regular Expression Operator Precedence\nI am ordering from Highest to Lowest Precedence:\n\nBracket Symbols: [:class:], [=a=], [.ab.]\n\\metacharacter\nBracket Expresssions [ ]\n(.....) and \\digit\n\nand {......}\n\n\nconcatenation (cde is c followed by d then by e)\n^ and $ anchors\n\nRegular Expression Matching\n\nRegular Expression match the longest possible, leftmost occurrence of text that can be matched\nIt is said that regular expressions are greedy by default in this way\n\n\nThe regex match stops at the first character that cannot be matched\nIf a text is matched then it is used even if a longer match exists further down the text\n\nIntermediate Grep Examples\n$ echo 891 you 588 | grep --color '[[:alpha:]]\\{2\\}'\n\nIt matches 2 characters here the yo\nbut\n$ echo 891 some 5888 | grep --color '[[:alpha:]]\\{2\\}'\n\nHere it matches the some the whole character set\n$ echo 589 him 999 | grep --color '[^[:alpha:]]\\{2\\}'\n\nHere it matches on 4 pairs:\nThe 58, 9 and space, a space and 9, and 99\n$ echo 589 him 999 | grep --color '[^[:alpha:][:space:]]\\{2\\}'\n\nHere it matched on 2 pairs:\nThe 58 and the 99\n$ echo 589 her 897 | grep --color '^[[:digit:]]*'\n\nHere it matches the digits at the beginning which happens to be 589\n$ echo her 888 | grep --color '^[^[:digit:]]*'\n\nThis matches anything that is not a digit at the beginning of the set so it matches her\n$ echo 567 vim 321 | grep --color '[^[:alpha:]]*$'\n\nThis matches any character that is not in alphabet and in the end of the set so it matches 321\n$ echo 567 abcd 789 himhim | grep --color '[aeiouhm]*'\n\n$ echo 567 abcd 789 himhim | grep --color '[aeiouhm]*'\n\nHere it didn't match with BSD grep but with gnu grep\n$ echo 567 abcd 789 himhim | ggrep --color '[aeiouhm]*'\n\nit matches with a,him, him like it should to match longest string\nThis seems to be a bug between bsd grep and gnu grep\nHere is an example using sed which will go into soon\n$ echo 567 aeod 888 houhou  | sed 's/[aeioud]*/D/'\n\nNotice a quirk here it matched on the null string which is at the beginning of the set\n$ echo 567 aeod 888 houhou  | sed 's/[aeioud][aeioud]*/D/'\n\n567 D 888 houhou\n\nHere it matched on the string aeod and replaced with D but it didn't match all occurrence because we need the g flag which does a global replace\necho 567 aeod 888 houhou  | sed 's/[aeioud][aeioud]*/D/g'\n\n567 D 888 hDhD\n\nNotice this time ou was replaced with D twice\nAlways quote your regular expressions on the command line or you will get unexpected behavior\nThings to be watch out for regular expressions:\n\nSubstitutions can match the null string in unexpected ways as you saw\n\nMatches will go with longest leftmost match\n\nRegular expressions can become cryptic very quickly so do take your time to read, write and to test them.\n\n\nExtended Regular Expressions\nSimiliarites to Basic Regular Expressions:\n\nMatching single characters\n\nRegular characters, ., escaped metacharacters\nBracket expressions: ranges and classes\n\n\nConduct repetition with * and inverval expressions ({.....})\n\nAnchor sets with ^ and $\n\nAlthough in EREs the ^ and $ are still special even in the middle of a Regular Expression\n\n\nMatches go with longest, leftmost match\n\n\nAdditional Repition Operators for EREs\n\nre? is zero or one of re\nso for example mother? would match one mother or none, meaning optional\n\n\nA note that re can be more than one character\nThis applies to * and {...} as well\n\n\n\nGrouping with Parenthesis\n\nParenthesis group smaller Regular Expressions into larger regexes\n([[:digit:]]{3}-[[:digit:]]{4})+ this matches one or more US phone numbers\nWe can even include repetition operators\n\n\nYou can't use backreferences with EREs\n\nAlternation\n\nAlternation means this or that\n(mayo|ketchup) will match either mayo or ketchup but not both\nAlternation is often used with parenthesis\n\n\nAlternation has the lowest precedence of all the operators\n^sorry|world$ will expand like this\n(^sorry)|(world$) and not like this ^(sorry|world)$ as you would think due to operator precedence\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Regular Expressions Operator Precedence\nOperator Precedence:\n\nBracket symbols: [:class:], [=c=], [.bs.], and [012345]\nMeaning the brackets themselves [  ]\n\n\n\\metacharacter\nBracket expressions [:alnum:]\n(.....) grouping\n*, +, ?, and {.....}\nConcatenation => who means w followed by h then followed by o\nAlternation\n\nEREs Examples\n$ echo ac abc abbc abbbc | egrep --color 'ab?c'\n\nThis matches ac and abc since ac does not have a b and it matched abc since it was one b\n$ echo ac abc abbc abbbc | grep -E --color 'ab?c'\n\nthis also works because -E puts grep in ERE mode\necho abc 531-2000 531-7777 cba | egrep --color '([[:digit:]]{3}-[[:digit:]]{4} )+\n\nThis uses grouping operator () and matches 3 digits, a - and 4 digits respectively\necho 'yo man\nhow are you' | egrep --color 'how|yo'\n\nThis matches yo twice once in yo and second in you and it matches how\n$ echo word and up | egrep --color '^word|up$'\n\nThis matches both word and up because of operator precedence\n$ echo word and up | egrep --color '^(word|up)$'\n\nThis doesn't match because we have more in the line than just word or up\necho abc 888-7777 999-1111 cba |\ngrep --color '\\([[:digit:]]\\{3\\}-[[:digit:]]\\{4\\} \\)\\+'\n\nThis matches using regular `grep with backslashes and interval expressions and grouping expressions and the plus operator\necho 'yo\nman\nhey' | grep --color '^\\(yo\\|man\\)$'\n\nNotice here that we need to escape with \\ but we match with yo, man\nNotice an example with sed and gsed\n$ echo yo and hey | sed 's/^yo\\|hey$/zzz/g'\n\nthis should have worked and replaced both yo and hey with zzz\nbut this example with gnu sed works\necho yo and hey | gsed 's/^yo\\|hey$/zzz/g'\nzzz and zzz\n\nMain programs that use EREs\n\negrep\ngrep with -E\nawk\nGNU grep and sed let you use \\?, \\+ and \\| to get the same ERE power but is not readable\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Basics of Shell Programming\nText

Examples\nBest Practices for Sed\nExercises\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nWhat is Sed\nSed (stream editor) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language.\nSed was developed by Lee McMahon in 1974.\nSed was the one of the first tools that supported regular expressions\nThe sed utility reads the specified files, or the standard input if no files are specified, modifying the input as specified by a list of commands.  \nThe input is then written to the standard output.\n\nSed can get input from command line files and/or standard input\n\nSed can use editing command from the command line and/or script\n\nSed outputs to standard output but original input files are changed\n\nYou can edit a file in place if you use -i option which will create a backup file and then edit file in place\n\n\nCommandline Options to Sed\nThe following options are available:\n\n-E Interpret regular expressions as extended (modern) regular expressions rather than basic regular expressions (BRE's).\n\n-r can be used in gnu sed\n\n\n-a The files listed as parameters for the w functions are created (or truncated) before any processing begins, by default.  \n\nThe * -a option causes sed to delay opening each file until a command containing the related ``w'' function is applied to a line of input.\n\n\n-e command\n\nAppend the editing commands specified by the command argument to the list of commands.\n\n\n-f command_file\n\nAppend the editing commands found in the file command_file to the list of commands.  \nThe editing commands should each be listed on a separate line.\n\n\n-i extension\n\nEdit files in* -place, saving backups with the specified extension.  \nIf a zero* -length extension is given, no backup will be saved.\nIt is not recommended to give a zero -length extension when in -place editing files,  as you risk corruption or partial content in situations where disk space is exhausted, etc.\n\n\n-l Make output line buffered.\n\n-n By default, each line of input is echoed to the standard output after all of the commands have been applied to it.  The * -n option suppresses this behavior.\n\n\nYou can mix -e and -f options together\nIf you don't provide options then first command line argument is the script\nBasic Sed Usage\nSed Manual\nsed [-Ealn] [-e command] [-f command_file] [-i extension] [file ...]\nAlthough sed has a large command set be wary of writing unwieldy scripts as they will be hard to read for others\nThe primary command is \"s\" (substitute) that does text replacements\nSed command structure\n\n  [  [  ] ]\n\n\n\none or two line numbers and use $ to mean last line\nPattern to match aka basic regular expression\n\n\n\n\nA single letter: s and p are most useful\n\n\n\n\nIn particular for s is the pattern to match and replacement text\nOther commands can take other operands\n\n\n\n\nFlags serve as modifiers for s command\n\n\n\nSubstitute command structure\ns  /  pattern  / replacement  / [flags]\nThe delimiter can be any punctuation character but the / is the most common delimiter\n\nUse \\/ in pattern or replacement for real / (forward slash) or another delimiter\n\npattern is a basic regular expression\n\nreplacement is the text to replace the matched input text\n\nFlags are optional modifiers\n\n\nSubstitute and Replacement text\nReplacement text can be:\n\nEmpty which means the matched text is deleted\n\nPlain Text which means matched text is replaced by contents of plain text\n\n& which means the text matching the pattern\n\necho you are the man | sed 's/you are the/& goat/g'\nNotice in this example the & was used as replacement text for the pattern text used\n\n\n\n\n\\& means a real &\n\n\\1 through \\9 is for text matched in \\(....\\) in the BRE (basic regular expression)\n\n\\\\ means a real \\ backslash\n\n\nSubstitute Flags\n\nAn optional flags will modify the behavior of the s command\n\nThe default behavior of substitution is to only replace the first occurrence\n\n\nPortable flags to use across various flavors of sed:\n\ng flag will replace every match on the input line\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or nth digit replace the nth occurrence\n\ni will ignore case but only works in gnu sed\n\n\nSed Examples\nExamples with s\n$ grep '2017-08-22' data/aapl.csv | sed 's/,.*//'\n\nNotice in this example we use grep to find the date 2017-08-22 and then pipe output to sed and remove everything after the comma\n$ sed 's/Liam/Frank/g' data/top-10-baby-names-2016.txt | sed 's/Charlotte/Katy/g'\n\nIn this example we use sed to replace the baby name Liam with Frank and then pipe that as stdin to replace Charlotte into Katy\n$ sed 's/Liam/Frank/g' data/top-10-baby-names-2016.txt | sed '/Charlotte/d'\n\nThis example changed Liam to Frank and then deleted the line for Charlotte\n$ sed 's/^/      /g' data/numbers.txt\n\nThis example prepends 8 spaces to beginning of line in numbers.txt\nExamples for filtering text\n$ sed -n '/Jacob/p' data/top-10-baby-names-2016.txt > data/jacob.txt\n\nThis example suppresses all output except matched text and prints it to stdout and then creates file called jacob.txt\nThere is a many more examples of sed usage this is just a sample.\nBest practices for Sed:\n\nThe longest, left-most matching basic regular expressions is critical for proper sed usage\n\nUse basic regular expressions over extended regular expressions and only use simple sed commands for portability and readability\n\nMake sure to use edit commands on the sed command line to make sustainable scripts\n\nsed is mainly used for text substitutions\n\nsed is used a lot in scripts with pattern matching and text replacement or deletion of text via substitution\n\nsed is often used in the middle of shell pipelines to transform data\n\n\nExercises\nUsing sed find all the occurrences of fries in the 'data/orders.txt' file and replace with French Fries\nOne Possible Solution:\n\n  \n    sed 's/Fries/French Fries/g' data/orders.txt\n  \n\n\nUsing sed delete the first row in the file data/orders.txt\nOne Possible Solution:\n\n  \n    sed '/^ID/d' data/orders.txt\n  \n\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Text Searching\nFilename expansions and globbing

Practices\nExtended Pattern Matching\nExtended Pattern Notations\nEnable Pattern matching\nExtended Pattern Matching Examples\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nTilde Expansion\nThe ~ is shorthand for a users home directory\n\n~/somefile is shorthand for a file in current users home directory\nIn my mac book ~ is short for /Users/marcelbelmont so ~/somefile would expand to /Users/marcelbelmont/somefile\nIn linux machines usually ~ would be /home/someuser\n\n\n~someuser/somefile would be for a file in a specific users home directory\ncd ~marcelbelmont/code-craftsmanship-organization/\nthis command would expand to cd /Users/marcelbelmont/code-craftsmanship-organization\n\n\n\n\nCommon extensions:\n~+ will use the current directory\n~- will use the previous directory\n\n\nThe tilde ~ will expand after variable expansion so you could do cd ~$USER which would work\n\nWildcards\nWildcards are like regular expressions but are simpler\nWildcards are used for file names while regular expressions are typically used for file contents\n\n* asterisk matches any sequence of characters much like use in regular expressions\n\nls .* will print out all hidden files in current directory\n\n\n? will match any single character like the . dot in regular expressions\n\nBracket expressions are like the regular expressions bracket expressions\n\nRanges and [[:class:]]\nBig difference is the complement though\nUse [!...] instead of [^...] to complement\n\n\n\n\nAnchoring is done implicitly\n\n*.c => ^.*\\.c$\nremember the ^ and $ will anchor the name to this\nlike word.c or something\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden Files\nBy convention files and directories whose names start with a dot are not shown by either ls and are not matched by wildcards\nIf you want to see hidden files pass -a flag which means \"all\"\n\nls -a will print out all the files\n\n$ ls -a\n.  ..  .git  .gitignore  LICENSE  README.md  SUMMARY.md  _book    book.json  data  docs  node_modules  package.json  scripts\n\nNotice that this printed out all the files/directories in the repo\nls -l ~/.profile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 marcelbelmont 186 Jan 23  2017 /Users/marcelbelmont/.profile\n\nNotice here I am printing out .profile in my home directory with -l flag option which gives full description\nTilde Examples\nExample using extensions:\n$

/Users/marcelbelmont/code-craftsmanship-organization/unix-programming-and-regular-expressions-workshop\n\nNotice here that ~- prints out the previous path we were in while ~+ prints out the current path\nWildcard Examples\nLet use go to object file directory\n$ cd ~/code-craftsmanship-organization/unix-programming-and-regular-expressions-workshop/object-files\n\nRun the gcc utility to generate object files\n$ gcc -c helloWorld.c\n\nThis will generate an object file\n$ gcc helloWorld.o -o hello\n\nThis will generate an executable file called hello\n$ ls *.[!c]\n\nThis command works in bash but not the zsh\nHidden File Examples\nls ~/.bash*\n/Users/marcelbelmont/.bash_history\n/Users/marcelbelmont/.bash_profile\n/Users/marcelbelmont/.bashrc\n\n/Users/marcelbelmont/.bash_sessions:\n029688FD-3537-49D5-B14B-572B91E5DC3F.history\n029688FD-3537-49D5-B14B-572B91E5DC3F.historynew\n029688FD-3537-49D5-B14B-572B91E5DC3F.session\n80529834-95E5-41D0-81D4-D94A60984AE1.history\n80529834-95E5-41D0-81D4-D94A60984AE1.historynew\n80529834-95E5-41D0-81D4-D94A60984AE1.session\n8C1748D6-939A-4FBD-925F-0FBDBCFE729B.history\n8C1748D6-939A-4FBD-925F-0FBDBCFE729B.historynew\n8C1748D6-939A-4FBD-925F-0FBDBCFE729B.session\n\nNotice this command prints out all the hidden files/directories that start with .bash\nBest Practices\n\nYou need to be very carefule with spaces and *\n\n`rm *  .o\nthis will remove all files and then try to delete .o but that is already deleted\n\n\nMake sure to quote wildcard characters if you want to use them literally\n\nOlder shells don't support tilde expansion even though tilde expansion is part of the POSIX standard.\n\nIf you run scripts in a older shell then they may fail\n\n\nExtended Pattern Matching\nExtended Pattern Matching is availabe in Bash, ksh, zsh and probably other shells\nExtended Pattern is not part of the POSIX standard\nDon't rely on extended pattern matching though for portability though as some shells may not have it\nExtended patterns provide similar power that extended regular expressions provide\nExtended Pattern matching is a more powerful filename matching mechanism\nExtended Pattern Notations\n\n\n\nPattern\nERE equivalent\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n*(exp)\nexp*\nmeans zero or more of an exp\n\n\n+(exp)\nexp+\nmeans one or more of an exp\n\n\n?(exp)\nexp?\nmeans zero or one of exp\n\n\n@(exp1|exp2|...|expn)\nexp1 pipe exp2\nThis is alternation\n\n\n!(exp)\nNo equivalent notation\nmeans complement of exp\n\n\n\nEnable Pattern matching\nUse command shopt in bash\n$ shopt --help\nshopt: shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname ...]\n    Set and unset shell options.\n\n    Change the setting of each shell option OPTNAME.  Without any option\n    arguments, list all shell options with an indication of whether or not each\n    is set.\n\n    Options:\n      -o    restrict OPTNAMEs to those defined for use with `set -o'\n      -p    print each shell option with an indication of its status\n      -q    suppress output\n      -s    enable (set) each OPTNAME\n      -u    disable (unset) each OPTNAME\n\n    Exit Status:\n    Returns success if OPTNAME is enabled; fails if an invalid option is\n    given or OPTNAME is disabled.\n\nTo enable extended pattern matching you do shopt -s extglob\nYou can see what shell options are enabled by simply typing shopt into shell or if it is enabled by the command you just entered\nUse command setopt in zsh to enable shell options\nUse command unsetopt to disable shell options\nSo to enable pattern matching in zsh do setopt extendedglob\nZsh options\nExtended Pattern Matching Examples\n$ cd data\n\nGo into data directory\n$ echo @(vincent|john|jenny)\n\nThis command prints out jenny john vincent in bash but doesn't work as intended in zsh\n$ echo *@(vincent|john|jingle)*\njingleheimer john vincent\n\nIn order to get jingleheimer we need to put * in front and after\nIf you see this message in bash extglob is not enabled bash: !: event not found\n$ ls !(*.o)\nhello  helloWorld.c\n\n\nThis prints out anything not an object file so in this case the executable and c file get printed to stdout\n\nThe equivalent zsh command is ls ^*.o\n\nUse the extended patterns if they are available\n!(...) in bash for complement and ^.. in zsh\n@(...) in bash for alternation is useful\nYou can use wildcards in the pattern like `!(*.o) in bash\nUse extended patterns where it makes sense\nSometimes using something like egrep will be faster than a shell function that is read line-by-line\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Text Substitution\nWorking with Fields →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/working-with-fields.html":{"url":"docs/working-with-fields.html","title":"Working with Fields","keywords":"","body":"Unix Programming and Regular Expressions Workshop -

data/population.txt\n\nIn this example we first delete Russia from cities.txt and then pipe this as stdin for join but it fails with join because we didn't sort the contents of the file cities.txt and when it encountered the file population.txt which wasn't sorted either it looked for a key Russia but didn't find it.\nsort data/cities.txt > data/cities.sorted.txt\n\nHere we sort cities.txt\nsort data/population.txt > data/population.sorted.txt\n\nand here we sort population.txt\nsed '/^Russia/d' data/cities.sorted.txt | join - data/population.sorted.txt\n\nThis command will pass because both files have been sorted and when join encounters key Russia that is not found it simply omits Russia from Output because population and cities didn't have the shared key anymore\nAnother way to do the same thing is to use Process Substitution:\njoin \nUsages for Cut and Join\n\nCut is a focused tool for a special task\nCut is a special command that cuts out either delimiter-separated fields or a range of characters\nCut is much simpler than sed and is used to extract individual fields from a file\nAlso there is some locale issues when cutting by a charactere so be cognizant of that\n\n\nJoin is also a focused tool for a special task\nJoin is a special command that selectively merges related data based on corresponding keys\nJoin must be sorted on the key field\nRemember from the example above we had to sort it, if you don't sort it may or may not work as was evidenced on the first sort example so always sort to avoid unexpected behavior\n\n\n\nAwk Description\nawk - pattern-directed scanning and processing language\nAwk scans each input file for lines that match any of a set of patterns specified literally in prog or in one or more files specified as -f progfile.  \nWith each pattern there can be an associated action that will be performed when a line of a file matches the pattern.\nEach  line  is  matched  against  the  pattern  portion of every pattern-action statement; the associated action is performed for each\nmatched pattern.  \nThe file name - means the standard input.  Any file of the form var=value is treated as an assignment, not  a  filename, and is executed at the time it would have been opened if it were a filename.  \nThe option -v followed by var=value is an assign-\nment to be done before prog is executed; any number of -v options may be present.  \nThe -F fs option defines the input field  separator\nto be the regular expression fs\nAwk options\n$ awk

of awk\nawk has several distributions:\n\nawk bsd style\nnawk is a version written by one of the original authors Brian Kernighan\ngawk is gnu awk and here is the Gawk Docs\nmawk is fast awk implementation\nlibmawk is a fork of mawk\nawka\ntawk\njawk\nxgawk\nqseawk\nImplementation of awk written by BusyBox\n\nWe will mainly look at bsd version of awk and gawk\nPatterns and Actions in Awk\nAwk programs operate on a series of patterns and actions\n$1 === \"marcel\" { increment_user++ }\nHere is an example\n\nPatterns in awk are done:\n\nRegular expression matching\n\nString Comparision\nNumber Comparison\nGeneral Test\nExtended Regular expressions\n\nawk actions are enclosed in braces and can do any computation\nVariables in awk are automatically initialized to 0 or \"\"\nEither the pattern or the action may be omitted in awk\nPatterns in Awk Docs\nActions in Awk Docs\nAwk Program Flow\n\nawk processes command line options and parses program text\nawk will execute any startup actions\nawk will loop until it is done\nawk will read a record\nawk will split a record into fields\nawk will test each pattern (your program code) against a record.\nawk will run corresponding action if the action matches\n\n\nawk will execute any cleanup actions\n\nAwk fields\nAn input line in awk is known as a record\nRecords in awk consist of fields that are separated by whitespace\nYou can set field separators on the command line or use the FS variable\nIn awk you use the variables $1, $2, ... , $n and so on for each field\nNF is the number of fields in a current record\nYou can use NF for the last field in a record\nYou use $0 for the whole record in awk\nSet Field Separator in awk\nYou can set field separator in 2 places:\n\ncommand line wth -F option\n\nawk -F: 'some program text' /etc/passwd | some pipe operation\n\n\nIn an awk program.\n\nYou assign a string to FS\n3 different \"modes\" in awk:\nFS = \" \" number of whitespace separated fields\nFS = \"character\" Number of instances of character separated fields\nFS = \"re\" Each field separated by text that matches \"re\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinting lines in Awk\nprint statements only appear in the actions parts in awk\nThe print statement is mainly used for simple formatting\nprint \"Order\", $2, \"Amount:\", $1\nThe printf statement is used for formatted text\nprintf(\"Order: %s\\tAmount: %g\\n\", $2, $1)\nprintf docs\nMany languages have a printf function\nAs you saw earlier in the workshop you need to put \\n in printf to print a final newline\nAwk Startup and Cleanup Actions\nStartup and Cleanup\nBegin and End Rules\nYou provide code that runs before reading any records like so:\nBEGIN {\n  code here ...\n}\n\nYou then can provide code to run after all the records have been processed\nEND {\n  code here ...\n}\n\nThe keywords BEGIN and END can begin anywhere in your awk program.\nBEGIN and END can be used multiple times in an awk program.\nFurthermore BEGIN and END are run in the order that they appear in your awk program\nAwk examples\nawk -F , '{ print $2 }' data/information.txt\n\nThe field separator is , is in this awk program\nHere is a breakdown of each field:\n\nName\nRank\nHeight\nYears of Service\n\nIt prints out the Rank field here\nIf we wanted to delete the the First Row we can pipe the output to sed like this:\nawk -F , '{ print $2 }' data/information.txt | sed '/Rank/d'\n\nAnother way to do this using awk is to do:\nawk -F , '$2 != \"Rank\" { print $2 }' data/information.txt\n\nNotice here we put double quotes (\") around Rank\nOr another way to do this is:\nawk -F , 'FNR != 1 { print $2 }' data/information.txt\n\n// TODO: Add xargs example with awk\nNow we get the following output:\nSSG\nSSG\nPVT\nSGT\nCPT\nawk -F : '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd\n\nThis awk command line program sets field separator to :, then it prints out the first field for each record of /etc/passwd\nsed -n '25p' /etc/passwd\n\nNotice with sed we print the 25th line of /etc/passwd\nwhich has the following content:\n_serialnumberd:*:58:58:Serial Number Daemon:/var/empty:/usr/bin/false\nThis can vary with different /etc/passwd files\nHere is a breakdown of each field:\n\n_serialnumberd\n*\n58\n58\nSerial Number Daemon\n/var/empty\n/usr/bin/false\n\nSo in total there is 7 fields in each record that is field separated with : character\nsed '/^#/d' /etc/passwd | awk -F : '{ print $6 }'\n\nWhat do you think gets printed in this awk program?\nawk -F : '$NF ~ /\\/bin\\/sh/ { print }' /etc/passwd\n\nThis script counts with $NF which is a special variable in awk the number of records that have users that use /bin/sh. Notice here that I had to escape the / with a \\ to get the literal /. Since we don't specify any field it will print all the fields that matched\nAlso remember $1 is the first field of the record\nawk -F : '$5 ~ /PostgreSQL Server/' /etc/passwd\n\nThis awk program looks in the 5th field for each record for the pattern /PostgreSQL Server/ using the ~ operator and then prints out the entire record that matched\nawk -F : '$5 ~ /PostgreSQL Server/ { print $1 }' /etc/passwd\n\nThis example explicitly prints out first field _postgres because we used the curly braces and the print command\ncat data/orders.txt\nID,ORDER DESCRIPTION,PRICE\n1,Hamburger,2.50\n2,Fries,1.00\n3,Hamburger,2.50\n4,Shake,2.75\n5,Fries,1.00\n6,Hamburger,2.75\n\nThis simple file has a list of orders\nawk -F ',' '$2 ~ /Hamburger/ { total += $3 } END { print \"total: \", total }' data/orders.txt\n\nThis awk program sets , as field delimiter and then searches in the second field for the pattern Hamburger and then it creates variable total that sums up 3rd field which is the price and then prints the total in the end for any Mat.\n./scripts/working-with-fields/bank_statement.sh data/bank_statement.csv\n\nWe will look at this script and explain contents line by line but one thing we will discuss is that the first line has a shebang and takes the -f option because we will provide a data file to it.\nTips for awk programs\nRemember when using regular expression matching and string comparison in awk programs that locales come into effect.\nWhen using multiple source files with awk you need to order them correctly in the command line\nRemember for portability that certain flavors of awk have different features so try not to use to many special functions if your script is to be used across many environments\nIf portability is not a real issue then try to use gnu awk as it is the most feature rich version of awk\nThe concept of patterns and actions in awk brings a powerful abilithy to describe data that needs to be processed.\nSince awk automatically reads records and performs field splitting you can focus on your data and what to do with your data\nAlso awk is a much more powerful unix tool than sed as it is a turing complete programming language and sed is just a streaming editor at heart\nExtended regular expressions give awk more power\nExercises\nFor the exercise we will work with the a sample file that is a copy of the /etc/passwd\nHere is a quick rundown of the /etc/passwd this information was explained in cyberciti :\n\nUsername: It is used when user logs in.

If output_file is absent, standard output is used for output.\nThe second and succeeding copies of identical adjacent input lines are not written.\nRepeated lines in the input will not be detected if they are not adjacent, so it may be necessary to sort the files first\nThe uniq command compares adjacent lines and the default behavior is for it to remove duplicates\nComparison is based on the

occurred in the input,followed by a single space.\n-d Only output lines that are repeated in the input.\n-f num  Ignore the first num fields in each input line when doing comparisons.  \nA field is a string of non-blank characters separated from adjacent fields by blanks.  \nField numbers are one based, i.e., the first field is field one.\n\n\n-s chars\nIgnore the first chars characters in each

assign variables you do somevar=somevalue \n\nDon't use spaces around the = sign\nYou need to quote values if the value contains some whitespace\nYou don't need to quote if you assigning a value\nFOO=foo; bar=$FOO\nFOO variable is assigned so we just assign bar to it with quotes\n\n\nYou can do multiple assignments in one line\n\nbar='BAR' foo=FOO baz=BAZ\n\necho $bar $foo $baz\nBAR FOO BAZ\n\nNotice here we created three variables in one line with no issues because the assignments worked from left to right\nSome shells give you concatenation capability like so:\nsomevar+=somevalue which will concatenate a value to the end of $somevar but this is not defined in POSIX so be wary for portability's sake\nCreate Global variables\nA shell environment has a list of name/value pairs (aka associative array, or dictionary) that are accesible to all programs in the shell\nChild programs in the shell will inherit the shell environment from the Parent program\nTo make globally accessible variables use the export command \nexport BAZ=baz\nThis will do 2 things:\n\nIt will give the value 'baz' to BAZ\nIt will create a name/value pair that is available to child programs.\n\nThe export -p command will print all global shell variables\nRead only variables\nThe command readonly somevar=value will 3 things:\n\nAssign value to somevar\nIt will disallow changing somevar\nIt will not put somevar into shell environment like export command\n\nreadonly immutable='Will not change me'\n\nHere we create a readonly variable\nimmutable='this will not work'\n\nZsh prints this output: zsh: read-only variable: immutable\nBash prints this output: bash: immutable: readonly variable\nIf you use readonly -p it will print the read-only variables\nIn zsh here is the output: typeset -r immutable='Will not change me'\nIn bash here is the output:\nbash-4.4$ readonly immutable='Will not change me'\nbash-4.4$ immutable='this will not work'\nbash: immutable: readonly

command\nunset will remove shell variables and functions\nunset options:\n\nunset with no options or with -v will just remove variables\nunset -f will remove shell functions\n\nWhen you use unset it will also remove variables from the shell environment\n\n\nVariable Best Practices\n\nDon't put spaces around the = when doing variable assignments\nMake sure to quote values that have whitespace\nexported variables will share the same namespace as regular variables\nI haven't seen much use of read-only variables even though I introduced them\n\nParameter expansions\nParameters consist of regular shell variables(baz=BAZ)\nCommand line argument like this:\n\n$1, ... $n\n$#\n$#,\n$@,\n$*\nWe have discusses these already earlier\n\n$? ==> this gives you exit status code\n\n\nParameter expansion is the way you get values from different parameters\nCommand line arguments\n\n$1, ..., ${8} is individual positional parameters\n$@ and $* will get all arguments but their expansion will behave differently in quotes as was discussed earlier in the workshop\n$# is the count of command line arguments\nshift command will drop an argument from left side and decrement $# and is used in shell scripts\n$0 is the name of the shell program or could a function\n$- will give options given to shell at invocation awk -f\n$$ will show process ID of current shell process\n$? will show exit status of last background command\n$! will show process ID of last background command\n$HOME is the current users home directory for example my home is /Users/marcelbelmont\n$IFS is the set input field separator characters\n$ENV is the startup file for interactive shells\n\nSimple Parameter Expansion\nAs you have seen already to get variable value you need to precede $ to variable name like $HOME\nIf you want to use a variable but it is enclosed in a variable\necho \"my home directory is ${HOME}\"\nmy home directory is /Users/marcelbelmont\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nAction\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n${var:-word}\nIf the variable exists and is not null return it else return the word\nIts purpose is to return if a variable is not defined\n\n\n${var:=word}\nIf var exists and is not null return it else assign word\nIts purpose is to set a variable to a default value if it is not defined already\n\n\n${var:?message}\nIf var exists and is not null return it else print message\nIts purpose is to catch errors if a variable is not defined\n\n\n${var:+word}\nIf var exists and is not null return the word else return null\nIts purpose is to test if a variable exists and has a value\n\n\n\nOther types of expansions\n\n\n\nOperator\nAction\n\n\n\n\n${var#pattern}\ndelete shortest matching text from front of value\n\n\n${var##pat}\ndelete longest text from front of value\n\n\n${var%pattern}\ndelete shortest matching text from end of value\n\n\n${var%%pattern}\ndelete longest matching text from end of value\n\n\n\nParameter expansion examples\necho $HOME\n\nThis expansion prints out /Users/marcelbelmont\nsleep 3 & echo $!\n\nThis command sleeps for 3 seconds and prints out job process number. The echo $! prints out the last process id of job running in the background.\nNotice that when the job finishes we run echo $! and the PID (Process Identification Number) is still the same.\necho _$USER_\n\nThis just prints out _\necho _${USER}_\n_marcelbelmont_\n\nThis works because variable expansion \ngrep '^four' data/numbers.txt; echo $?\n\nThis prints out 1 which means grep failed\necho My PID is $$\nMy PID is 1596\n\nThis show PID for the current shell sessiono\nWe can confirm this with the ps command\nps\n  PID TTY           TIME CMD\n  406 ttys000    0:00.03 /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS\n  410 ttys000    0:00.60 -zsh\n 1596 ttys001    0:00.82 /usr/local/bin/zsh -l\n\nNotice here that 1596 is the PID for our current shell session as we expect\necho ${number:-0}\n0\n\nSince number does not exist, echo returns 0\necho ${number:=0}\n\nThis returns 0 since number is not set but it sets number to 0.\nnumber=10\n\necho ${number:=0}\n\nThis time echo prints out 10 since number is set\necho ${number:-0}\n\nThis also prints out 10 since number has been set\nmypath=/Users/marcelbelmont/code/very.long.file.name\n\necho ${mypath#/*/}\nmarcelbelmont/code/very.long.file.name\n\nThis prints out everything minus /Users/\necho ${mypath##/*/}\nvery.long.file.name\n\nNotice here that expansion just prints last part of file\necho ${mypath%.*}\n/Users/marcelbelmont/code/very.long.file\n\nNotice that this removes .name or the shortest matching part\necho ${mypath%%.*}\n/Users/marcelbelmont/code/very\n\n Notice this removed the longest matching part long.file.name\n Using these expansions let you avoid using basename and dirname which need to be run a separate process so these expansions can make your shell scripts more efficient with resources.\nParameter expansion best practices\n\nRemember that when you use $@ and $* there is quoting quirks\n$$ will often be used when creating temporary filenames\nmktemp is a better command to use for this purpose\n\n\nIn general the most useful general expansion is ${value:-someval} and ${value:=somevalue}\nThe ${var#pattern} type parameter expansions can be good for manipulating pathnames and filenames\n\nArithmetic Expansion\nThis type of expansion because expr is harder to use\nIn order to do arithmetic expansion use $(( expression )) to get the result of an arithmetic into a command line expression or for a variable assignment\n\nYou can access variable values by preceding with or without the $\n\nThe $((  expression )) acts like double quotes\n\nResult is placed into a command line but side-effects are possible through variable assignment\n\n\nArithmetic Operator Table\n\n\n\nOperator\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n++ --\nIncrement / decrement\n\n\n+ -\nUnary plus, minus, logical and bitwise negation\n\n\n* / %\nMultiply, Divide, Remainder\n\n\n+ -\nBinary addition, Binary subtraction\n\n\n >>\nLeft Shift, Right Shift\n\n\n  > >=\nComparison Operators\n\n\n== !=\nEqual, Not Equal\n\n\n&\nBitwise AND\n\n\n^\nBitwise Exclusive OR\n\n\n|\nBitwise OR\n\n\n&&\nLogical AND (Short Circuit)\n\n\n||\nLogical OR (Short Circuit)\n\n\n?:\nConditional Expression\n\n\n= += -= *= /= %= etc\nAssignment Operators\n\n\n\nLet Command\nThe let \"expression\" is used for arithmetic\n\nIts purpose is to do arithmetic and to test result in a if statement or loop\n\nExit status is 0 for non-zero result and 1 for zero result so this is inverse of shell success status which returns 0 for success\n\n\nthe let expression works same as $(( expression ))\n\nThere is an alternate syntax in bash (( expression )) with no preceding $ this is not defined in POSIX so may not work in other shells\n\nThis alternate syntax was designed to make shell scripts look like regular programming languages\n\n\nArithmetic Expansion Examples\namount=100\n\npercent=15\n\necho Total: $((  amount + ( (amount * percent) / 100) ))\n\nHere we use $(( )) notation to save arithmetic value\nj=50\n\necho my answer is $(( ++j ))\n51\n\nUsing prefix operator we increment j and save it to j variable\necho $j\n51\n\ni=30\n\necho my answer is $(( i++ ))\nmy answer is 30\n\nThe difference in postfix operator is that i returns 30 but when we inspect i it was incremented to 31\necho $i\n31\n\nz=10\n\necho $(( z += 2 ))\n12\n\nHere += assigns 12 to z\nmysolution=13\n\nNow let us use if condition to check\nif (( mysolution == 8 ))\nthen\necho \"This is my solution\"\nelse\necho \"what did my solution end up being?\"\nfi\n\nNotice here use ((  )) to check if mysolution is equal to 8 or not\nArithmetic Expansion Best Practices\nArithmetic expansion is used to perform arithmetic instead of using expr command\nPOSIX restricts arithmetic to C language long integers\nYou can use let nd (( expression )) in bash and zsh but this notation isn't necessarily portable to other shells\nArithmetic expansion helps provide integer arithmetic using a notation familiar to other programming languages\nBuilt-in math is much faster and easier to use than expr command\nBuilt-in math is easier to write and read\nBash and zsh also provide commands for arithmetic that can be used in if, while and until loops\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Text Sorting\nDecision Making and Exit Status

This allows programs that normally only accept files to directly read from or write to another program.\n\nBy using process substitution you can create nonlinear pipelines:\n\nThere can be multiple process streams that can provide input to one command\nOne comand can send output to multiple process streams\nThe tee command is good for process substitution\n\n\n\nProcess Substitution Syntax\n\nA command  to be read from a pipeline\n\ndiff \n\n\nA command >(d | e | ...) to write to a pipeline\n\n\ntee >(sort | uniq > sorted.dat) \\\n>(do_something)\n> myFile\n\ndiff -u \nHere we sort 2 files and pass it to diff command as process substitution\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Input and Output\nHistory Substitution →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/history-substitution.html":{"url":"docs/history-substitution.html","title":"History Substitution","keywords":"","body":"Unix Programming and Regular Expressions Workshop - History Substitution\nSections:\n\nHistory Description\nHistory Options\nHistory Event Designators\nHistory Examples\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nHistory Description\nHistory Command)\n\nThe history command manipulates this history list. \n\nIn its simplest form, it prints the history list.\n\nOptions allow for the recall and editing of particular commands and for setting parameters such as the number of past commands to retain in the list.\n\n\nHistory Options\nhistory: history [-c] [-d offset] [n] or history -anrw [filename] or history -ps arg [arg...]\nDisplay or manipulate the history list.\nDisplay the history list with line numbers, prefixing each modified\nentry with a `*'.

Inside the function, it\ngets assigned the first value that is passed in.\nUsage\nYou can invoke shell functions just like shell commands.\nArguments are passed as $1, $2, ..., $n.  Likewise, $#, $*, and $@ work\nsimilarly to a script's command line arguments.\nThe main script arguments are shadowed by the function's arguments while the function is\nrunning.  In other words, if you need to access the script's arguments (vs the\nfunction's), you will have to assign them to another variable, or pass them in as\narguments to the function.\nThe return statement is used to return a status to the shell script.  You shouldn't use\nexit to return a status in a shell function.  Since functions do not run in a separate\nprocess, this will actually exit the shell script itself (or your login shell, if you're\nexecuting the function on the command line).\nIf you need to return a value (instead of, or in addition to a status), you can use\necho, or printf, or whatever output-producing command you like.  Such as:\nbash$ type today\ntoday is a function\ntoday ()\n{\n    local TODAY=$(date +\"%Y%m%d\");\n    echo \"Today is $TODAY\";\n    return 42\n}\nbash$ today\nToday is 20171205\nbash$ echo $?\n42\nbash$ thedate=$(today)\nbash$ echo $?\n42\nbash$ echo \"I got $thedate\"\nI got Today is 20171205\n\nOne thing to note when using functions on the command line.  Shell aliases are evaluated\nbefore functions (see the doc on Evaluation Order).

This file name is unique and suitable for use by the application.  \nThe template may be any file name with some number of Xs appended to it, for example /tmp/temp.XXXX.The trailing Xs are replaced with the current process number and/or a unique letter combination.  \nThe number of unique file names mktemp can return depends on the number of Xs provided; six Xs will result in mktemp selecting 1 of 56800235584 (62 ** 6) possible file names.  \nOn case-insensitive file systems, the effective number of unique names is significantly less; given six Xs, mktemp will instead select 1 of 2176782336 (36 ** 6) possible unique file names.\nIf mktemp can successfully generate a unique file name, the file is created with mode 0600 (unless the -u flag is given) and the filename is printed to standard output.\nThe mktemp utility is provided to allow shell scripts to safely use temporary files.  \nTraditionally, many shell scripts take the name of the program with the pid as a suffix and use that as a temporary file name.  \nThis kind of naming scheme is predictable and the race condition it creates is easy for an attacker to win.  \nA safer, though still inferior, approach is to make a temporary directory using the same naming scheme. \nWhile this does allow one to guarantee that a temporary file will not be subverted, it still  allows a simple denial of service attack.  \nFor these reasons it is suggested that mktemp be used instead.\nIf no template is provided then mktemp provides a default template\nmktemp Command Options\nmktemp command options:\n\n-d Make a directory instead of a file.\n\n-q Fail silently if an error occurs.  This is useful if a script does not want error output to go to standard error.\n\n-t prefix\n\nGenerate a template (using the supplied prefix and TMPDIR if set) to create a filename template.\n\n\n-u Operate in unsafe mode.  \n\nThe temp file will be unlinked before mktemp exits.  \nThis is slightly better than mktemp but still introduces a race condition.  \nUse of this option is not encouraged.\n\n\n\nmktemp Command Examples\ncmp line1 line2\n\nHere we compare line1 and line2 which are identical\necho $?\n\nHere we check the exit status of the cmp command which returns 0 meaning the 2 files are identical\ncmp line1 line3\n\nHere the 2 files are different so we get this output\nline1 line3 differ: char 1, line 1\ncmp /etc/passwd /etc/group\n\nHere the files /etc/passwd and /etc/group differ as well like this:\n/etc/passwd /etc/group differ: char 6, line 2\necho $?\n\nThe exit status here is 1 meaning the files differ\ncmp -l line1 line3\n\nHere we compare line1 and line3 using -l for long listing output showing the differences on each byte\ncmp -s line1 line3\n\nHere we use the -s option to suppress the output\nWhen this is done in a shell script normally you check the exit status\necho $?\n\nThis will output 1\n#! /bin/sh\n\n## Here we trap the command when pseudo EXIT signal is given so that we cleanup temp files that were created\ntrap 'rm -f $tmpfile $tmpfile2' EXIT\n\ntmpfile=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/someprogram.$$\n\necho Here is a simple line > $tmpfile\n\nls -l $tmpfile\necho\ncat $tmpfile\n\necho\n\numask 077\ntmpfile2=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/someprogram.$$.2\n\necho Another line to write here > $tmpfile2\n\nls -l $tmpfile2\n\necho \n\ncat $tmpfile2\n\nRemember this parameter expansion assignment ${var:-word} Its purpose is to return if a variable is not defined\nHere we are creating a temporary file using the common but vulnerable naming scheme we mentioned previously\n./temp-files.sh\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 marcelbelmont staff 22 Nov 12 20:55 /var/folders/s4/szxqn65j3tz89r6c5z786x2m0000gn/T//someprogram.57340\n\nHere is a simple line\n\n-rw------- 1 marcelbelmont staff 27 Nov 12 20:55 /var/folders/s4/szxqn65j3tz89r6c5z786x2m0000gn/T//someprogram.57340.2\n\nHere we are using umask instead of chmod because we are setting the permission bits in creation time for tmpfile2\n#! /bin/bash\n\n# Run trap for cleanup no matter what\ntrap 'rm -f $tmpfile' EXIT\n\ntmpfile=$(mktemp -p /tmp someprogram.XXXXXXXXXXX) || exit 1\n\necho Here is some data again > $tmpfile\n\nls -l $tmpfile\n\necho\n\ncat $tmpfile\n\nThe difference in this script is that we are using the mktemp utility\nHere is the output of this shell script:\n-rw------- 1 marcelbelmont wheel 24 Nov 12 21:27 /tmp/someprogram.OaZPcfjZ6oc\n\nHere is some data again\n\nNotice that mktemp entered random symbols for the XXXXX placeholder\nAlso notice that we didn't have to use umask because mktemp set the proper security permissions for us\n#! /bin/bash\n\ntrap 'rm -f $tmpfile' EXIT\n\ntmpfile=$(mktemp -p /dev anotherprogram.XXXX) || exit 1\n\necho Some data here for a file > $tmpfile\n\nls -l $tmpfile\n\necho \n\ncat $tmpfile\n\nHere we try to run mktemp on the /dev directory but it is not a writable directory so this will fail with this error \nmktemp: failed to create file via template ‘/dev/anotherprogram.XXXX’: Permission denied\nFile Permissions\nls -l\ntotal 24\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 marcelbelmont   0 Nov 14 17:15 bad-practice.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 marcelbelmont  15 Nov 12 20:08 line1\n-rw-r--r-- 1 marcelbelmont  15 Nov 12 20:08 line2\n-rw-r--r-- 1 marcelbelmont  31 Nov 12 20:11 line3\n-rw-r--r-- 1 marcelbelmont   0 Oct  5 09:17 program.sh\ndrwxrwxrwx 3 marcelbelmont 102 Nov 14 17:20 really-bad-directory\n-rw-r-Sr-- 1 marcelbelmont   0 Nov 14 17:07 stick-bit.txt\n-rwSr--r-- 1 marcelbelmont   0 Nov 14 17:09 stick-bit.txt2\n-rwsr-sr-x 1 marcelbelmont   0 Nov 14 17:09 stick-bit.txt3\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 marcelbelmont 178 Nov 12 21:24 temp-files-with-mktemp-version2.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 marcelbelmont 217 Nov 12 21:22 temp-files-with-mktemp.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 marcelbelmont 305 Nov 12 20:53 temp-files.sh\n\nYou can see file Permission Bits in the following ls command above in the root of the repository\nThere are 3 specific types of file permissions:\n\nread \n\nThe read permission grants the ability to read a file.

When set for a directory, this permission grants the ability to modify entries in the directory. This includes creating files, deleting files, and renaming files.\n\n\nexecute\n\nThe execute permission grants the ability to execute a file. This permission must be set for executable programs, including shell scripts, in order to allow the operating system to run them. When set for a directory, the execute permission is interpreted as the search permission: it grants the ability to access file contents and meta-information if its name is known, but not list files inside the directory, unless read is set also.\n\n\n\nNotice that there are 10 entries\n\n\n\nDirectory\nUser\nGroup\nOther\n\n\n\n\nX\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nThis First Character Indicates the File Type (i.e File or Directory)\nwhat the user/owner can do\nwhat the group members can do\nwhat other users can do\n\n\n\ncd scripts/working-with-files\n\nls -l bad-practice.txt\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 marcelbelmont 0 Nov 14 17:15 bad-practice.txt\n\nNotice here the order for XXX => r (read) w (write) x (execute)\ndrwxrwxrwx 3 marcelbelmont 102 Nov 14 17:20 really-bad-directory\n\nHere is a directory that has read, write, execute for owner/user, group, and others\n\n\n\nMode\nName\nOctal Value\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nr\nread\n4\nread a file or list a directory's contents\n\n\nw\nwrite\n2\nwrite to a file or directory\n\n\nx\nexecute\n1\nexecute a file or recurse a directory tree\n\n\nX\nspecial execute\n--\nIt applies execute permissions to directories regardless of their current permissions and applies execute permissions to a file which already has at least one execute permission bit already set\n\n\ns\nsetuid/gid\n--\nThe symbolic modes use s to represent the setuid and setgid modes\n\n\nt\nsticky\n--\nWhen a directory's sticky bit is set, the filesystem treats the files in such directories in a special way so only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or root user can rename or delete the file\n\n\n\nchmod +t stick-bit.txt\n\nHere we set the sticky bit for the user\nls -l stick-bit.txt\n-rw-r-Sr-T 1 marcelbelmont 0 Nov 14 17:07 stick-bit.txt\n\nNotice here that we have a T at the end of the triad which is the sticky bit\nA trick to remembering how to add octal values\n_  _  _\n4    2   1\nThe first _ has 4 which stands for read permission\nThe second _ has 2 which stands for write permission\nThe third _ has 1 which stands for execute permission\nIf you add up 4 + 2 you get read and write Permission = 6\nIf you add up 4 + 1 you get read and execute Permission = 5\nIf you add up 2 + 1 you get write and execute permission = 3\nIf you add up 4 + 2 + 1 you get read, write, and execute permission = 7\nchmod Command Description\nchmod -- change file modes or Access Control Lists\nThe chmod utility modifies the file mode bits of the listed files as specified by the mode operand.

Physical\nBit\nTransmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium\n\n\n\nLayer 5: Session Layer:\n\nThe session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. \n\nIt establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. \n\nIt provides for full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. \n\nThe OSI model made this layer responsible for graceful close of sessions, which is a property of the Transmission Control Protocol, and also for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not usually used in the Internet Protocol Suite. \n\nThe session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls.\n\n\nOpenssh replacement tools\nOpenSSH is a suite of secure network connectivity tools that replaces:\n\ntelnet / telnetd \nrcp\nrsh / rshd\nrlogin / rlogind\nftp / ftpd\n\nNone of these older tools encrypt traffic, everything comes over clear text and they can be sniffed with tools like Wireshark\nUnlike the tools they replace, OpenSSH tools encrypt all traffic, including passwords. \nOpenssh tools can thwart attackers who attempt to eavesdrop, hijack connections, and steal passwords.\ntelnet Command Description\ntelnet -- user interface to the TELNET protocol\nThe telnet command is used to communicate with another host using the TELNET protocol.  \nIf telnet is invoked without the host argument, it enters command mode, indicated by its prompt (telnet).  \nIn this mode, it accepts and executes the commands listed below.  \nIf it is invoked with arguments, it performs an open command with those arguments.\ntelnet Command Option\ntelnet command options:\n\n-4 Forces telnet to use IPv4 addresses only.\n\n-6 Forces telnet to use IPv6 addresses only.\n\n-8 Specifies an 8-bit data path.  \n\nThis causes an attempt to negotiate the TELNET BINARY option on both input and output.\n\n\n-E Stops any character from being recognized as an escape character.\n\n-F If Kerberos V5 authentication is being used, the -F option allows the local credentials to be forwarded to the remote system, including any credentials that have already been forwarded into the local environment.\n\n-K Specifies no automatic login to the remote system.\n\n-L Specifies an 8-bit data path on output.  This causes the BINARY option to be negotiated on output.\n\n-N Prevents IP address to name lookup when destination host is given as an IP address.\n\n-S tos  Sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) option for the telnet connection to the value tos, which can be a numeric TOS value or, on systems that support it, a symbolic TOS name found in the /etc/iptos file.\n\n-X atype\n\nDisables the atype type of authentication.\n\n\n-a Attempt automatic login.  \n\nThis is now the default, so this option is ignored.  Currently, this sends the user name via the USER variable of the ENVIRON option if supported by the remote system.  The name used is that of the current user as returned by getlogin if it agrees with the current user ID, otherwise it is the name associated with the user ID.\n\n\n-c Disables the reading of the user's .telnetrc file.\n\n-d Sets the initial value of the debug toggle to TRUE.\n\n\nRead the Fine Manual for more options\ntelnet Command Examples\ntelnet www.google.com 80\n\nIf you enter this command you should see \nTrying 173.194.206.99...\nConnected to www.google.com.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n\nIf you press Control ] then you will get into telnet prompt\nYou can also get into prompt by simply typing in telnet\ntelnet\n\nThis will start an interactive telnet session with telnet prompt\nType ? to see the available options\ntelnet towel.blinkenlights.nl\n\nThis will start in an interactive telnet session to watch star wars\nIn order to quit press Control ] and then type quit command to exit telnet session\ntelnet\n\nthis gets you into interactive telnet prompt\no telehack.com\n\nThis will get telnet session started for telehack.com\ntype in eliza to get session with a computerized Psychotherapist\nPress Control ] to get back into telnet prompt\nType quit command to exit telnet\ntelnet freechess.org 5000\n\nThis will take you into telnet session with freechess.org\nType guest if you aren't a registered user\nType quit to get out or type ? to see all the options\nftp Command Description\nftp -- Internet file transfer program\nftp is the user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Protocol.  \nThe program allows a user to transfer files to and from remote network site.\nThe last five arguments will fetch a file using the FTP or HTTP protocols, or by direct copying, into the current directory.  \nThis is ideal for scripts.\nftp Command Options\nftp command options:\n\n-4 Forces ftp to only use IPv4 addresses.\n\n-6 Forces ftp to only use IPv6 addresses.\n\n-A Force active mode ftp.  \n\nBy default, ftp will try to use passive mode ftp and fall back to active mode if passive is not supported by the server.  \nThis option causes ftp to always use an active connection.  It is only useful for connecting to very old servers that do not implement passive mode properly.\n\n\n-a Causes ftp to bypass normal login procedure, and use an anonymous login instead.\n\n-d Enables debugging.\n\n-e Disables command line editing.  This is useful for Emacs ange-ftp mode.\n\n-f Forces a cache reload for transfers that go through the FTP or HTTP proxies.\n\n-g Disables file name globbing.\n\n-i Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.\n\n\nRead the Fine Manual for more options\nftp Command Examples\nftp domain.com\n\nThis won't work but is an example of accessing a site\nftp > ls\n\nThis will list files in the remote directory\nftp\n\nThis will get you into an interactive ftp session\nftp > ?\n\nThis will out all the available ftp command in an interactive session\nftp > ? lcd\nlcd            change local working directory\n\nThis prints out a description of the ftp command lcd\nssh Command Description\nSSH Description\nssh -- OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)\nssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine.  \nIt is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  \nX11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.\nssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user name).  \nThe user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using one of several methods.\nssh Command Options\nssh command options:\n\n-1 Use protocol version 1 only.\n\n-2 Use protocol version 2 only.\n\n-4 Use IPv4 addresses only.\n\n-6 Use IPv6 addresses only.\n\n-A Enable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.\n\n-a Disable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.\n\n-C Use data compression\n\n-c cipher_spec Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.\n\n-D [bind_address:]port Dynamic application-level port forwarding. This allocates a socket to listen to port on the local side. When a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.\n\n-E log_file Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.\n\n-F config file Specifies a per-user configuration file. The default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.\n\n-g Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.\n\n-i identity_file A file from which the identity key (private key) for public key authentication is read.\n\n-J [user@]host[:port] Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to the pjump host[(/iam/jump-host) and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.\n\n-l login_name Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.\n\n-p port Port to connect to on the remote host.\n\n-q Quiet mode.\n\n-V Display the version number.\n\n-v Verbose mode.\n\n-X Enables X11 forwarding.\n\n\nssh config options\nHost firsthost\n    SSH_OPTION_1 custom_value\n    SSH_OPTION_2 custom_value\n    SSH_OPTION_3 custom_value\n\nHost secondhost\n    ANOTHER_OPTION custom_value\n\nHost *host\n    ANOTHER_OPTION custom_value\n\nHost *\n    CHANGE_DEFAULT custom_value\n\nAll the available options can be found by Reading the Fine Manual.\nYou can do man ssh_config for all the available options for the client in /etc/ssh/ssh_config or you can create your own options in ~/.ssh/config for user options\nRequirements to Run Secure shell\nTo run a secure shell on or securely copy a file to or from a remote system you must meet the following requirements:\n\nThe remote system must be running the OpenSSH daemon (sshd)\nThere needs to be an account on the remote system\nThe SSH server must positively identify itself to the client\n\nls -al ~/.ssh\n\nI have the following in the ~/.ssh directory:\ntotal 16\ndrwx------    5 marcelbelmont  170 Oct  3  2016 .\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 163 marcelbelmont 5542 Nov 22 14:31 ..\n-rw-------    1 marcelbelmont 1675 Sep 19  2016 id_rsa\n-rw-r--r--    1 marcelbelmont  421 Sep 19  2016 id_rsa.pub\n-rw-r--r--    1 marcelbelmont 4752 Oct 21 08:09 known_hosts\n\nIf you don't have any ssh keys or want a new key then create another key by doing the following command:\nssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -C \"johnrambo@hero.net\"\n\nHere we are generating a new key using ecdsa type key with key length of 521 bits and with a comment of email type of \"johnrambo@hero.net\"\nHere is the sample output for the command given above:\nGenerating public/private ecdsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/Users/marcelbelmont/.ssh/id_ecdsa):\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nEnter same passphrase again:\nYour identification has been saved in /Users/marcelbelmont/.ssh/id_ecdsa.\nYour public key has been saved in /Users/marcelbelmont/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub.\nThe key fingerprint is:\nSHA256:LF3IksGBcXTYv9mDj4KD33oMOb0kfX+MP5Heo/FVshU johnrambo@hero.net\nThe key's randomart image is:\n+---[ECDSA 521]---+\n|    .==+.        |\n|    ..o=..       |\n|      o o..

Larger buffers require fewer round trips at the cost of higher memory consumption.  The default is 32768 bytes.\n\n\n-b batchfile\n\nBatch mode reads a series of commands from an input batchfile instead of stdin.  Since it lacks user interaction it should be used in conjunction with non-interactive authentication.\n\n\n-C Enables compression (via ssh's -C flag).\n\n-c cipher\n\nSelects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfers.

make\n\nNotice here that when you run it you get the following output:\necho \"nothing\"\nnothing\n\nBecause we specified the target some_binary first it is the default target\nAll it does is run the echo command. \nNotice that it printed out the execution of the echo \"nothing\" and then it printed out \"nothing\"\nThe exit status of make can be one of three values:\n\n0 \n\nThe exit status is zero if make is successful.\n\n\n2\n\nThe exit status is two if make encounters any errors. \nIt will print messages describing the particular errors.\n\n\n1\n\nThe exit status is one if you use the ‘-q’ flag and make determines that some target is not already up to date.\n\n\n\ncd scripts/build-automation/example2; make\n\nNotice here that when we run make here we only get the output nothing instead.\nWe will discuss this further later but an at sign (@) will suppress output to standard output\nMakefile Rules\nA makefile consists of rules.\nThe first command may appear on the same line after the prerequisites, separated by a semicolon\ntargets : prerequisites ;

[target] : prerequisites ... [prerequisites]\n\nThis generic example illustrates that having multiple targets and prerequisites but no commands\nMakefile Prefixes\nA makefile target can have one of three prefixes:\n\na hyphen-minus (-), specifying that errors are ignored\n\nan at sign (@), specifying that the command is not printed to standard output before it is executed.\n\na plus sign (+), the command is executed even if Make is invoked in a \"do not execute\" mode\n\n\nMakefile Definitions\nA target is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program.\nExamples of targets are executable or object files.\nA target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as 'clean' (see Phony Targets).\nA prerequisite is a file that is used as input to create the target. \nA target often depends on several files.\nA recipe is an action that make carries out. \nA recipe may have more than one command, either on the same line or each on its own line. Please note: you need to put a tab character at the beginning of every recipe line! \nThis is an obscurity that catches the unwary. \nIf you prefer to prefix your recipes with a character other than tab, you can set the .RECIPEPREFIX variable to an alternate character.\na_failure:\necho \"Will not work\"\n\nThis makefile will not work\ncd scripts/build-automation/example4; make\n\nIf you run this makefile in your terminal you will see the following error:\nmakefile:2: * missing separator.  Stop.\nUsually a recipe is in a rule with prerequisites and serves to create a target file if any of the prerequisites change. \nHowever, the rule that specifies a recipe for the target need not have prerequisites. \nFor example, the rule containing the delete command associated with the target 'clean' does not have prerequisites.\nA rule, then, explains how and when to remake certain files which are the targets of the particular rule. \nmake carries out the recipe on the prerequisites to create or update the target. \nA rule can also explain how and when to carry out an action.\nA makefile may contain other text besides rules, but a simple makefile need only contain rules. \nRules may look somewhat more complicated than shown in this template, but all fit the pattern more or less.\nMakefile Macros\nA makefile can contain definitions of macros. \nMacros are usually referred to as variables when they hold simple string definitions, like \"CC=clang\".\nMacros in makefiles may be overridden in the command-line arguments passed to the Make utility. \nEnvironment variables are also available as macros.\nMacros allow users to specify the programs invoked and other custom behavior during the build process.\nNew macros (or simple \"variables\") are traditionally defined using capital letters\nA macro is used by expanding it\nTraditionally this is done by enclosing its name inside $()\nAn equivalent form uses curly braces rather than parenthesis, i.e. ${}\nThis is more common in BSD Unix flavors like Mac OS X.\nMY_NAME = \"Jean-Marcel\"\n\nprint_my_name:\n    @echo $(MY_NAME)\n\nNotice here that we defined a macro named MY_NAME and used command prefix @ to suppress output of echo command execution\ncd scripts/build-automation/example5; make\n\nYou can see the output of the above makefile by running the snippet above\nMY_NAME = \"Jean-Marcel\"\n\nprint_my_name:\n    @echo ${MY_NAME}\n\nHere we get the same output but used ${} instead of $() to expand the makefile MACRO\nMacros can be composed of shell commands by using the command substitution operator, denoted by backticks (`).\nHere is another example of shell commands:\nSOME_DATE = `date \"+DATE: %Y-%m-%d%nTIME: %H:%M:%S\"`\n\nprint_date_in_past:\n    @echo ${SOME_DATE}\n\nIn this example we can't use $() but need to use the ` ` instead\nMACROS can be overriden in the commandline by doing the following:\nmake MACRO=\"value\" [MACRO=\"value\" ...] TARGET [TARGET ...]\nMY_NAME = \"Jean-Marcel Belmont\"\n\nprint my_name:\n    @echo $(MY_NAME)\n\nHere we defined the MY_NAME MACRO\ncd scripts/build-automation/example9; make\n\nHere we get the following output:\nJean-Marcel Belmont\nIf we however run make like this:\n`make MY_NAME=\"John Rambo\"*\nthen the MY_NAME macro is overriden and the value John Rambo is printed to stdout instead\nmakefiles also have some predefined MACROS \nYou can find a complete list of MACROS HERE\nYou can also use environment variables as MACROS\nprint_my_environment_variable:\n    @echo $$MY_VAR\n\nNotice here that we had to access the environment variable with $$ syntax.\nThe reason being is that each line of a makefile is parsed first using the makefile syntax, and then the result is passed to the shell so you have to wrap it in 2 $ signs\ncd scripts/build-automation/example10; export MY_VAR=\"SOME VALUE\"; make\n\nWhen we run the following snippet from above we get the output SOME VALUE to stdout\nDefault command\nSOME_VAR := \"Hello there\"\n\n# Default target since it comes first\nall:\n    @echo $(SOME_VAR)\n\n\n# This target can be run with `make list`\nlist:\n    @cd test; \\\n    ls\n\nNotice here that we created a comment with # and that a default argument of all is created simply because it came first in the makefile\ncd scripts/build-automation/example11; make\n\nThis will print out Hello there\nmake list\n\nThis will cd into test directory and print out contents\nMakefile Tasks\n# Makefile with specific designed tasks\n\nall: program1 program2 program3\n\nprogram1: program1.js\n                    node program1.js\n\nprogram2: program2.js\n                    node program2.js\n\nprogram3: program3.js\n                    node program3.js\n\nNotice here that we have specified 3 makefile tasks\nThe all task runs program1, program2, and program3 tasks respectively\nThe all task is the default task because it comes first in the Makefile\nIn the program1 task here is the breakdown:\n\nprogram1.js is given as a dependency\nThe command node program1.js is run\n\nFor each of the tasks given to the default task of all this occurs\ncd ./scripts/build-automation/makefile-tasks; make\n\nNotice that output of the 3 different program files when you run the command above.\nIncluding Other Makefiles\nThe include directive tells make to suspend reading the current makefile and read one or more other makefiles before continuing. \nThe directive is a line in the makefile that looks like this:\ninclude somefile.mk\n# Makefile with include directive\n\nall: program1 program2 program3 program4\n\nprogram1: program1.js\n                    node program1.js\n\nprogram2: program2.js\n                    node program2.js\n\nprogram3: program3.js\n                    node program3.js\n\ninclude someprogram.mk\n\nNotice the include directive in this makefile.\nWe also added program4 target to tasks in all target\nRunning make with different named file\nThe makefile can be given a different name than the 3 files:\n\nGNUmakefile\nmakefile\nMakefile\n\nBy using the commandline options: -f, --file=file, or --makefile=FILE\nContents of Node_Build_Script\n# Another named makefile\nprogram2: program2.js\n                    node program2.js\n\nTo run this file you can do the following:\n\nmake -f Node_Build_Script\nmake --file=Node_Build_Script\nmake --makefile=Node_Build_Script\n\nAutomatic variables and Wildcards\nAutomatic Variables\n\n\n\nAutomatic Variable\nComputed Value\n\n\n\n\n$@\nThe file name of the target of the rule. If the target is an archive member, then ‘$@’ is the name of the archive file. In a pattern rule that has multiple targets (see Introduction to Pattern Rules), '$@' is the name of whichever target caused the rule’s recipe to be run.\n\n\n$%\nThe target member name, when the target is an archive member. See Archives. For example, if the target is foo.a(bar.o) then '$%' is bar.o and '$@' is foo.a. '$%' is empty when the target is not an archive member.\n\n\n$\nThe name of the first prerequisite. If the target got its recipe from an implicit rule, this will be the first prerequisite added by the implicit rule (see Implicit Rules).\n\n\n$?\nhe names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with spaces between them. For prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used\n\n\n$^\nThe names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them. For prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used (see Archives). A target has only one prerequisite on each other file it depends on, no matter how many times each file is listed as a prerequisite. So if you list a prerequisite more than once for a target, the value of $^ contains just one copy of the name. This list does not contain any of the order-only prerequisites; for those see the ‘$\n’ variable, below.\n\n\n$+\nThis is like ‘$^’, but prerequisites listed more than once are duplicated in the order they were listed in the makefile. This is primarily useful for use in linking commands where it is meaningful to repeat library file names in a particular order.\n\n\n$\\\n\nThe names of all the order-only prerequisites, with spaces between them.\n\n\n$*\nThe stem with which an implicit rule matches (see How Patterns Match). If the target is dir/a.foo.b and the target pattern is a.%.b then the stem is dir/foo. The stem is useful for constructing names of related files. In a static pattern rule, the stem is part of the file name that matched the ‘%’ in the target pattern.\n\n\n\nSome people refer to these automatic variables as wildcards in makefile\nLet us look at a makefile for a golang project\n# Variables\nBUILD_DIR := build\nBUILD_MANIFEST := wildcard\nBUILD_OUT := -o ${BUILD_DIR}/wildcard\n\n# Targets\nall: package files homedirectory\n\npackage:     compile\n                    tar -czf ${BUILD_DIR}/wildcard.tar.gz -C ${BUILD_DIR} ${BUILD_MANIFEST}\n\ncompile:     wildcard.go\n                    mkdir -p ${BUILD_DIR}\n                    rm -rf ${BUILD_DIR}/*\n                    go build ${BUILD_OUT}/wildcard\n\nfiles:     *.go\n                echo $?\n\nhomedirectory: ~\n                echo $?\n\ntest:    \n                    go test ./...\n\nclean:\n                    rm -rf ${BUILD_DIR}\n\nNotice here that we have several targets and variables for this makefile.\nWe also used a couple of targets with wildcard operators *, and ~\nNotice that *.go printed out all the go source files in current directory\nAlso notice that the ~ printed out current directory\ncd ./scripts/build-automation/wildcards; make\n\nThis will run the default target of all and its tasks\ncd ./scripts/build-automation/wildcards; make test\n\nThis will run the go tests using the test target\ncd ./scripts/build-automation/wildcards; make clean\n\nThe clean target will run remove the build directory\nHere we will look at another makefile that examines some more automatic variables\ngoFiles := $(wildcard *.go)\n\nshowAutomaticVariables: automatic\n\nautomatic:     ${goFiles}\n                        echo $@\n                        echo $\nHere we have a variable and several targets\nTo get this started run the following:\ncd ./scripts/build-automation/makefile-automatic-variables; touch one.go second.go; touch third.go; make\n\nYou will see the following output:\necho automatic\nautomatic\necho one.go\none.go\necho one.go second.go third.go\none.go second.go third.go\necho one.go second.go third.go\none.go second.go third.go\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\necho $@ => prints out default target of automatic\necho $ => prints out first filed created of one.go\necho $? => prints outs all the prerequisites newer than the target which in this case is all the files\necho $^ => prints out all the prerequisites\n\nYou can read about more Automatic Variables Here\nWildcard functions and other make functions\nThe make utility has a WildCard Function\n as well as more functions\nsrc := $(wildcard *.c)\n\nall: compile\n\ncompile:     ${src}\n                    gcc ${src} -o printStuff\n                    ./printStuff\n\n Here I am using the wildcard function and notice that is wrapped in $() and we call the wildcard function which finds all the c source files in the current directory.\n Then the default target of all call compile target which compiles source file into a binary executable called printStuff\n Lastly printStuff binary is invoked and some statements are printed to stdout\ncd ./scripts/build-automation/makefile-wildcard-function; make\n\nYou can run the makefile by executing the command above in your terminal\nPhony Targets\nSuppose you have the following makefile:\nall: compile\n\ncompile:     one.o two.o three.o\n                    gcc one.o two.o three.o\n\none.o :     one.c\n                    gcc -c one.c\n\ntwo.o :     two.c\n                    gcc -c two.c\n\nthree.o : three.c\n                    gcc -c three.c\n\nclean:\n                    rm *.o\n\nHere we have a list of targets that have object files as dependencies and then has a clean target that removes all of the object files\ncd ./scripts/build-automation/phony-target-issue; make; make clean\n\nThis works fine but suppose you do the following now:\ntouch clean\n\nNow rerun make clean and look at the output:\nmake: `clean' is up to date.\nNotice that no matter what it reports clean is up to date \nThis is because you created a target file of clean and the make utility believes there is nothing left to do.\nThis is where the concept of the PHONY target comes into place\nLet us look at this makefile now:\nall: compile\n\ncompile:     one.o two.o three.o\n                    gcc one.o two.o three.o\n\none.o :     one.c\n                    gcc -c one.c\n\ntwo.o :     two.c\n                    gcc -c two.c\n\nthree.o : three.c\n                    gcc -c three.c\n\n.PHONY: clean\n\nclean:\n                    rm *.o\n\nNotice now that we can run make clean and it works, it is because of the .PHONY target we just created which helps fix the issue of an existing file called the same name as the target\nLet us now look at the previous makefile that had several targets specified:\n# Variables\nBUILD_DIR := build\nBUILD_MANIFEST := wildcard\nBUILD_OUT := -o ${BUILD_DIR}/wildcard\n\n# Targets\nall: package files homedirectory\n\npackage:     compile\n                    tar -czf ${BUILD_DIR}/wildcard.tar.gz -C ${BUILD_DIR} ${BUILD_MANIFEST}\n\ncompile:     wildcard.go\n                    mkdir -p ${BUILD_DIR}\n                    rm -rf ${BUILD_DIR}/*\n                    go build ${BUILD_OUT}/wildcard\n\nfiles:     *.go\n                echo $?\n\nhomedirectory: ~\n                echo $?\n\ntest:    \n                    go test ./...\n\n.PHONY: clean\n\nclean:\n                    rm -rf ${BUILD_DIR}\n\nHere we created a .PHONY target for the clean task because clean should not be associated with a file\nCommands\nMakefile commands help update targets\nRemember that commands begin with a tab and follow the shell syntax\nTarget : Prerequisite ;

        fmt.Println(err)\n        }\n        defer f.Close()\n        convertToJSON(f, true)\n    }\n}\n\nNotice here that I just used the flag builtin library and it does the job of parsing command line flags.\nAlso dealing with asychronous code in Golang is much easier than using Node.js. \nThere are many design patterns built into Golang that make writing commandline applications a joy to work with.\nQuick summary\nYou can write cli apps use either Node.js or Golang but consider writing a command line application in Golang. \nLink to Golang Workshop\nI wrote a Golang workshop which you can check out if you aren't familiar with Go.\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Build Automation\nShell Login Order

/etc/profile.d/dircolors.sh script uses the ~/.dircolors and /etc/dircolors files to control the colors of file names in a directory listing. \nThey control colorized output of things like ls --color. \nThe explanation of how to initialize these files is at the end of this section.\n/etc/profile.d/extrapaths.sh\nThis script adds several useful paths to the PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variables.\nThis will allow executables in the current working directory to be executed without specifiying a ./, however you are warned that this is generally considered a security hazard\nThis script adds some useful paths to the PATH and can be used to customize other PATH related environment variables (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc) that may be needed for all users.\nSample Entry for this

them originated on Unix systems, but several later ports to other operating systems exist.\nList of Networking Utilities\nCommon Networking Tools:\n\nping, ping a host to check connectivity (reports packet loss and latency, uses ICMP).\n\nifconfig ifconfig is a system administration utility in Unix-like operating systems for network interface configuration.\n\nipconfig ipconfig (internet protocol configuration) in Microsoft Windows is a console application that displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and can modify Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) settings.\n\nnetcat Netcat (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.\n\nnetstat, displays network connections (both incoming and outgoing), routing tables, and a number of network interface and network protocol statistics. \n\nIt is used for finding problems in the network and to determine the amount of traffic on the network as a performance measurement\n\n\nnmap Nmap (Network Mapper) is a security scanner, originally written by Gordon Lyon (also known by his pseudonym Fyodor Vaskovich), used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus building a \"map\" of the network.\n\ntraceroute shows the series of successive systems a packet goes through en route to its destination on a network. \n\nIt works by sending packets with sequential TTLs which generate ICMP TTL-exceeded messages from the hosts the packet passes through.\n\n\ndig dig (domain information groper) is a network administration command-line tool for querying Domain Name System (DNS) servers.\n\n\nping command description\nping -- send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts\nThe ping utility uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway. \nECHO_REQUEST datagrams (pings) have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a struct timeval and then an arbitrary number of pad bytes used to fill out the packet.\nping command options\nList of ping options:\n\n-i wait Wait wait seconds between sending each packet.  \n\nThe default is to wait for one second between each packet.  \nThe wait time may be fractional, but only the super-user may specify values less than 0.1 second.\nThis option is incompatible with the -f option.\n\n\n-c count Stop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE packets.\n\nIf this option is not specified, ping will operate until interrupted.  \nIf this option is specified in conjunction with ping sweeps, each sweep will consist of count packets.\n\n\n-f Flood ping. Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second, whichever is more.  \n\nFor every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period '.' is printed, while for every ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed.  \nThis provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped. \nOnly the super-user may use this option.  \nThis can be very hard on a network and should be used with caution.\n\n\n-a Audible. Include a bell (ASCII 0x07) character in the output when any packet is received.  \n\nThis option is ignored if other format options are present.\n\n\n-s packetsize Specify the number of data bytes to be sent. \n\nThe default is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.  \nThis option cannot be used with ping sweeps.\n\n\n-W waittime Time in milliseconds to wait for a reply for each packet sent.  \n\nIf a reply arrives later, the packet is not printed as replied, but considered as replied when calculating statistics.\n\n\n\nRead the Fine Manual for more options\nping command examples\nping 8.8.8.8\n\nHere we use the ping command to see if google.com is up\nping -i 1 127.0.0.1\n\nHere we see if localhost is up and running and wait 1 second before sending the next packet\nping -c 3 www.google.com\n\nHere we send 3 packets to www.google.com and then ping quits\nsudo ping -f localhost\n\nHere using sudo privileges we flood localhost with packets\n--- localhost ping statistics ---\n1645 packets transmitted, 1000 packets received, 39.2% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.007/0.019/0.060/0.005 ms\n\nHere is sample output session\nThe -f option provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped\nping -a 8.8.8.8\n\nThe -a command option does an audible bell on each successful packet sent\nping -c 1 www.google.com\n\nHe we send 1 count to www.google.com\nNotice that we get the output:\nPING www.google.com (216.58.218.228): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 216.58.218.228: icmp_seq=0 ttl=52 time=38.605 ms\n\n--- www.google.com ping statistics ---\n1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 38.605/38.605/38.605/0.000 ms\n\nHere we can also see the IP_ADDRESS: 216.58.218.228 that maps to www.google.com host name\nping -c 3 -q 127.0.0.1\n\nHere we send 3 packets and only show the summary information by using -q command option which quiets output\nping -s 50 localhost\n\nThis specifies a packet size of 50 to localhost\nifconfig command description\nifconfig -- configure network interface parameters\nThe ifconfig utility is used to assign an address to a network interface and/or configure network interface parameters.\nifconfig command options\n\n-a Display information for all network interfaces, even if they are down.\n\n-s Display a short list in a format identical to the command \"netstat -i\".\n\n-v Verbose mode; display additional information for certain error conditions.\n\ninterface The name of the interface. This is usually a driver name followed by a unit number, for example \"eth0\" for the first Ethernet interface. \n\nup This flag causes the interface to be activated. \n\nIt is implicitly specified if an address is assigned to the interface.\ndown    This flag causes the driver for this interface to be shut down.\n\n\n[-]arp    Enable (or disable, if the \"-\" prefix is specified) the use of the ARP protocol on this interface.\n\n[-]promisc    Enable (or disable, if the \"-\" prefix is specified) the promiscuous mode of the interface. \n\nIf promiscuous mode is enabled, all packets on the network will be received by the interface.\n\n\n[-]allmulti    Enable or disable all-multicast mode. If multicast mode is enabled, all multicast packets on the network will be received by the interface.\n\nmetric N This parameter sets the interface metric, which is used by the interface to make routing decisions. N must be an integer between 0 and 4294967295. If you're not sure what a network metric is, or whether you should change it, you can safely leave this setting alone.\n\nnetmask address    Set the IP network mask for this interface. \n\nThis value defaults to the usual class A, B or C network mask (as derived from the interface IP address), but it can be set to any value.\n\n\nadd address/prefixlen    Add an IPv6 address to an interface.\n\ndel address/prefixlen    Remove an IPv6 address from an interface.\n\ntunnel aa.bb.cc.dd Create a new SIT (IPv6-in-IPv4) device, tunnelling to the given destination.\n\n\nRead the Fine Manual for more options\nifconfig command examples\nifconfig\n\nHere we get the following output:\nlo0: flags=8049 mtu 16384\n    options=1203\n    inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000\n    inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128\n    inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1\n    nd6 options=201\ngif0: flags=8010 mtu 1280\nstf0: flags=0<> mtu 1280\nen0: flags=8863 mtu 1500\n    ether a4:5e:60:f3:b3:37\n    inet6 fe80::8fc:5c30:b69b:16f0%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x4\n    inet 192.168.0.7 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255\n    inet6 2606:a000:50d0:c600:1cb9:f213:74eb:9108 prefixlen 64 autoconf secured\n    inet6 2606:a000:50d0:c600:70a1:966f:7d89:3653 prefixlen 64 autoconf temporary\n    nd6 options=201\n    media: autoselect\n    status: active\nen1: flags=963 mtu 1500\n    options=60\n    ether 6a:00:00:81:e6:40\n    media: autoselect \n    status: inactive\nen2: flags=963 mtu 1500\n    options=60\n    ether 6a:00:00:81:e6:41\n    media: autoselect \n    status: inactive\nbridge0: flags=8863 mtu 1500\n    options=63\n    ether 6a:00:00:81:e6:40\n    Configuration:\n        id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0\n        maxage 0 holdcnt 0 proto stp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200\n        root id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0\n        ipfilter disabled flags 0x2\n    member: en1 flags=3\n            ifmaxaddr 0 port 5 priority 0 path cost 0\n    member: en2 flags=3\n            ifmaxaddr 0 port 6 priority 0 path cost 0\n    nd6 options=201\n    media: \n    status: inactive\np2p0: flags=8843 mtu 2304\n    ether 06:5e:60:f3:b3:37\n    media: autoselect\n    status: inactive\nawdl0: flags=8943 mtu 1484\n    ether 2e:35:d7:b0:d9:b5\n    inet6 fe80::2c35:d7ff:feb0:d9b5%awdl0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x9\n    nd6 options=201\n    media: autoselect\n    status: active\nutun0: flags=8051 mtu 2000\n    inet6 fe80::fe8b:356a:44f2:9f6e%utun0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xa\n    nd6 options=201\n\nNotice here we get multiple entries for network entries\nifconfig -a\n\nHere we list all the network interfaces no matter if they are up or not.\nifconfig en0\n\nHere we list the configuration of a specific interface by providing its name\nsudo ifconfig utun0 down\n\nHere we disable an active network interface using the down keyword\nifconfig utun0\n\nHere we look at the network interface and notice that it no longer shows the network interface as UP \nsudo ifconfig utun0 up\n\nHere we enable an active network interface using the up keyword\nifconfig utun0\n\nNotice we get the following output:\nutun0: flags=8051 mtu 2000\n    inet6 fe80::fe8b:356a:44f2:9f6e%utun0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xa\n    nd6 options=201\n\nNotice that UP is displayed because the network interface is up and running again\nsudo ifconfig utun0 162.72.169.1\n\nHere we assign the static IP_ADDRESS: 162.72.169.1 to the utun0 network interface\nnetstat command description\nnetstat -- show network status\nThe netstat command symbolically displays the contents of various network-related data structures.  \nThere are a number of output formats, depending on the options for the information presented.  \nThe 7 netstat command forms:\n\nThe first form of the command displays a list of active sockets for each protocol.  \n\nThe second form presents the contents of one of the other network data structures according to the option selected. \n\nUsing the third form, with a wait interval specified, netstat will continuously display the information regarding packet traffic on the configured network interfaces. \n\nThe fourth form displays statistics for the specified protocol or address family. \n\nIf a wait interval is specified, the protocol information over the last interval seconds will be displayed.  \n\nThe fifth form displays per-interface statistics for the specified protocol or address family.  \n\nThe sixth form displays mbuf statistics. \n\nThe seventh form displays routing table for the specified address family.

Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. \nWhile Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime\nIf you are on Mac OS X then you might have to install nmap\nIf you have homebrew package manager run brew install nmap\nnmap is often used by both ethical hackers and black hat hackers alike because of its many scripts and powerful features for network discovery\nnmap command options\nImportant nmap command options:\n\n-sP  Ping scans the network, listing machines that respond to ping.\n\n-p -sV -sS -T4 target Full TCP port scan using with service version detection\n\n-v -sS -A -T4 target Prints verbose output, runs stealth syn scan, T4 timing, OS and version detection + traceroute and scripts against target services.\n\n-v -sS -A -T5 target  Prints verbose output, runs stealth syn scan, T5 timing, OS and version detection + traceroute and scripts against target services.\n\n-v -sV -O -sS -T5 target Prints verbose output, runs stealth syn scan, T5 timing, OS and version detection.\n\n-v -p -sV -O -sS -T4 target Prints verbose output, runs stealth syn scan, T4 timing, OS and version detection + full port range scan.\n\n-v -p 1-65535 -sV -O -sS -T5 target Prints verbose output, runs stealth syn scan, T5 timing, OS and version detection + full port range scan.\n\n\nnmap command examples\nnmap 104.131.117.137\n\nHere we do a simple IP scan of IP_ADDRESS: 104.131.117.137\nnmap 104.131.117.137 www.marcelbelmont.com\n\nHere we scan the IP_ADDRESS: 104.131.117.137 and my blog www.marcelbelmont.com\nnmap  192.168.1.1-25\n\nHere we can an IP range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.25 addresses\nNotice that we get the following output:\nStarting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-12-10 16:11 EST\nNmap done: 25 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 12.07 seconds\n\nThere are no open ports available for this range of IP addresses\nnmap 104.131.117.137 -sL\n\nHere we don't do a scan but instead list targets\nnmap -p 1-65535 -sV -sS -T4 104.131.117.137\n\nThis command requires root access to work properly\nThis command will do a full TCP port scan using with service version detection -sV\nThis command also uses -sS also does default network scan.\nThe -T4 option is a more aggressive scanning option than the default -T3 option, so use if you have a good network connection\nThe -p 1-65535 will scan ports 1 to 65535\nBe mindful that nmap commands can take a while to complete so don't be surprised that some commands can take upwards of a minute to complete\nThe example output for this nmap command execution:\nStarting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-12-10 21:23 UTC\nNmap scan report for 104.131.117.137\nHost is up (0.40s latency).\nNot shown: 996 closed ports\nPORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION\n22/tcp   open  ssh      OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.6 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)\n80/tcp   open  http     nginx 1.4.6 (Ubuntu)\n443/tcp  open  ssl/http nginx 1.4.6 (Ubuntu)\n3000/tcp open  http     Node.js (Express middleware)\nService Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel\n\nService detection performed.

Passwords, or more correctly, the hash of the password, can also be stored in the same place. \nThe entries in /etc/passwd occupy exactly one line each\nThe entries in /etc/passwd occupy exactly one line each, and have the following form:\n\nnickname:password_hash:UserID:GroupID:Complete_Name:home_dir:shell_bin\n\nSince all users must have read access to the /etc/passwd file to do many common tasks (ls -l /home will use /etc/passwd to map UIDs to login names for example), anyone could also read the password hashes of other users. \nTo solve this problem, the file /etc/shadow was created to store the password hashes, with only root having read access. \nUnder password shadowing, the 2nd field (password hash) is replaced by an 'x' which tells the system to retrieve the corresponding user's password via the /etc/shadow file.\nThe /etc/shadow file often only contains values for the first two fields:\n\nxfze:$$1zuW2nX3sslp3qJm9MYDdglEApAc36r/:::::\nThe remaining fields in the /etc/shadow file include:\n\nThe minimum number of days between password changes\n\nThe maximum number of days until the password must be changed\n\nThe number of days of warning given before the password must be changed\n\nThe number of days after the password must be changed when the account becomes unusable\n\nThe date (expressed as the number of days since January 1st, 1970) when the account is expired\n\n\nA system administrator can use these fields in the /etc/shadow to enforce a password security policy.\nAny old users or groups should be promptly removed from the Unix System.\nsu, sudo, ssh only, no remote root logins\nKeep Software Up to Date\nSoftware Patching Wikipedia Section\nPatching\n\nOperating systems, like all software, may contain bugs in need of fixing or may be enhanced with the addition of new features. Patching the operating system in a secure manner requires that the software come from a trustworthy source and not have been altered since it was packaged. Common methods for verifying that operating system patches have not been altered include the use of cryptographic hash, such as an MD5 based checksum, or the use of read-only media.\n\nSource distributions\n\nSource distributions include the ability to examine the code for suspicious content. The drawback, absent an accompanying cryptographic hash value, is that the user must be able to perform a security analysis of the code themselves.\nRegardless of the vendor or distribution, all software distributions should provide a mechanism for verifying that the software is legitimate and has not been modified since it was originally packaged.\n\nOften an md5 checksum of the downloaded content is used to verify that you downloaded an untampered resource.\nUnderstand the Services Running in the Unix Environment\nDo not install unnecessary services in the system.\nAny software that is no longer needed should be removed from the system.\nIdentify what services are running :\n\nnetstat -na\n\nlsof\n\nnmap\n\nsockstat -4\n\n\nThe commands inetd and xinetd act as super-servers for a variety of network protocols such as rlogin, telnet and ftp.\nHere is a sample run of netstat in a ubuntu system:\n$ netstat -na\n\nActive Internet connections (servers and established)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:9333          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     \ntcp        0      0 127.0.1.1:53            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:631           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     \ntcp        0      0 192.168.0.14:35384      64.233.177.188:443      ESTABLISHED\ntcp        0      0 192.168.0.14:56538      192.241.178.140:443     ESTABLISHED\ntcp6       0      0 ::1:631                 :::*                    LISTEN     \ntcp6       0      0 2606:a000:50d0:c6:54216 2607:f8b0:4002:810::443 ESTABLISHED\ntcp6       0      0 2606:a000:50d0:c6:48316 2607:f8b0:4002:804::443 ESTABLISHED\ntcp6       0      0 2606:a000:50d0:c6:48314 2607:f8b0:4002:804::443 ESTABLISHED\ntcp6       0      0 2606:a000:50d0:c6:53842 2607:f8b0:4002:808::443 ESTABLISHED\nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:43326           0.0.0.0:*                          \nudp        0      0 127.0.1.1:53            0.0.0.0:*                          \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:68              0.0.0.0:*                          \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:631             0.0.0.0:*                          \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:51891           0.0.0.0:*                          \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5353            0.0.0.0:*                          \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5353            0.0.0.0:*                          \nudp6       0      0 :::57792                :::*                               \nudp6       0      0 :::5353                 :::*                               \nudp6       0      0 :::5353                 :::*                               \nraw6       0      0 :::58                   :::*                    7          \nActive UNIX domain sockets (servers and established)\nProto RefCnt Flags       Type       State         I-Node   Path\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     28568    /tmp/.org.chromium.Chromium.1VIs5h/SingletonSocket\nunix  2      [ ]         DGRAM                    24170    /run/user/1000/systemd/notify\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     netstat -na | less24171    /run/user/1000/systemd/private\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     SEQPACKET  LISTENING     10230    /run/udev/control\nunix  3      [ ]         DGRAM                    9874     /run/systemd/notify\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     27702    @christine-com.canonical.Unity.Scope.scopes.T1268472427719\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     24202    /run/user/1000/keyring/control\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     24508    /run/user/1000/keyring/pkcs11\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     24512    /run/user/1000/keyring/ssh\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     27704    @christine-com.canonical.Unity.Scope.applications.T1268524384910\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     16458    /sys/fs/cgroup/cgmanager/sock\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     25260    /run/user/1000/pulse/native\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     531649   /run/user/1000/vscode-git-askpass-ace0622bfd4151186f67e7466a8ebc0a7aaf5aaf.sock\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     25334    @/tmp/.ICE-unix/1660\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     55198    /run/user/1000/Code-1.19.1-main.sock\nunix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     55613    /run/user/1000/Code-1.19.1-shared.sock\n......................................................................\n\nFile System Security\nThis information was extracted from File System Security Wikipedia Section\n\nFile system security within UNIX and Unix-like systems is based on 9 permission bits, set user and group ID bits, and the sticky bit, for a total of 12 bits. \nThese permissions apply almost equally to all filesystem objects such as files, directories and devices.\nThe 9 permission bits are divided into three groups of three bits each. The first group describes the permissions of the file owner, the second group describes the permissions of a group associated with the file owner or the directory containing the file, and the third group describes the permissions associated with any process which does not have the same user ID as the file. Each group of three bits contains a bit indicating the read, write or execute access is granted. In the case of directories, execute access is interpreted as the permission to perform a filename lookup within the directory.\nThe set user ID and set group ID bits, commonly abbreviated set-UID and set-GID respectively, are used to change the identity of the process which executes a file having either or both of those bits set. A file having the set-UID permission bit set will cause a process which executes that file to temporarily switch the effective user ID to that of the file owner. A file having the set-GID permission bit set will cause a process which executes that file to temporarily switch the effective group ID to that of the file group. A process may then alternate between the effective user or group ID which it inherited from the file and the real user or group ID which it inherited when the user logged on to the system. This provides a mechanism by which a process may limit the access rights it possesses to those code regions which require those access rights. This is a form of a security technique known as privilege separation and improves program security by limiting the unintended or undesirable actions of a processes.\nA directory having the set-GID permission bit set will cause a newly created file to have an initial file group value equal to the file group of the directory. This provides a mechanism whereby a subsystem, such as the system's mail subsystem, can create files which have a common file group value so that set-GID processes within that subsystem are then able to read or write the file.\nThe sticky bit, formally known as the save text on swap bit, derives its name from its original purpose. Originally the sticky bit caused a process's initial memory image to be stored as a contiguous image on the disk drive which was used to store real memory pages when they were not in use. This improved the performance of commonly executed commands by making the initial memory image readily available. Modern UNIX systems no longer perform that function when the bit is set, but the name has been preserved nonetheless. In the case of files, the sticky-bit may be used by the system to indicate the style of file locking to be performed. In the case of directories, the sticky bit prevents any process, other than one which has super-user privileges or one having an effective user ID of the file owner, from deleting a file within that directory. The sticky bit is most commonly used on publicly writable directories, such as the various temporary working space directories on the system.\n\nWe discussed in great detail the permission bits on the Working with Files Section\nSELinux\nSELinux Wikipedia\n\nSecurity-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies, including United States Department of Defense–style mandatory access controls (MAC).\n\nSELinux features include:\n\nclean separation of policy from enforcement\nwell-defined policy interfaces\nsupport for applications querying the policy and enforcing access control (for example, crond running jobs in the correct context)\nindependence of specific policies and policy languages\nindependence of specific security-label formats and contents\nindividual labels and controls for kernel objects and services\nsupport for policy changes\nseparate measures for protecting system integrity (domain-type) and data confidentiality (multilevel security)\nflexible policy\ncontrols over process initialization and inheritance and program execution\ncontrols over file systems, directories, files, and open file descriptors\ncontrols over sockets, messages, and network interfaces\ncontrols over the use of \"capabilities\"\ncached information on access-decisions via the Access Vector Cache (AVC)\n\nViruses in Unix Systems\nUnix-like operating systems are immune to most Microsoft Windows viruses because binaries created to run on Windows generally won't run on other platforms. \nHowever, many Unix like installations provide file storage services to Microsoft Windows clients, such as through the use of Samba software, and may unintentionally become a repository for viruses stored by users. \nIt is common for Unix servers to act as mail transfer agents; consequently; email virus scanning is often installed. The ClamAV virus scanner is available in source code form and may be used to scan Unix file systems for viruses which infect other operating systems.\nThere are viruses and worms that target Unix-like operating systems. In fact, the first computer worm—the Morris worm—targeted Unix systems.\nNetwork Firewalls\n\nIn computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted outside network, such as the Internet.\n\niptables\niptables is the current user interface for interacting with Linux kernel netfilter functionality. \nIt replaced ipchains. Other Unix like operating systems may provide their own native functionality and other open source firewall products exist.\n\niptables requires elevated privileges to operate and must be executed by user root, otherwise it fails to function. On most Linux systems, iptables is installed as /usr/sbin/iptables and documented in its man pages, which can be opened using man iptables when installed. It may also be found in /sbin/iptables, but since iptables is more like a service rather than an \"essential binary\", the preferred location remains /usr/sbin.\n\nRead the iptables Wikipedia Page for more details on iptables\nShellshock Bash Bug\nPlease read the Shellshock Wikipedia Page\n\nShellshock, also known as Bashdoor, is a family of security bugs in the widely used Unix Bash shell, the first of which was disclosed on 24 September 2014. Many Internet-facing services, such as some web server deployments, use Bash to process certain requests, allowing an attacker to cause vulnerable versions of Bash to execute arbitrary commands. This can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a computer system\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Network Utilities\nFind and Replace Patterns →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/find-and-replace-patterns.html":{"url":"docs/find-and-replace-patterns.html","title":"Find and Replace Patterns","keywords":"","body":"Unix Programming and Regular Expressions Workshop - Find and Replace Patterns\nSections:\n\nDefining Regexes with online tool\nCapture Groups\nBackreferences for a regular expression\nEditor Example for Find and Replace\nUsing Find and Replace with the Shell\nAdvanced Find and Replace Patterns\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nDefining Regexes with online tool\nThere are a handful of ways to define a regex but we will cover some online tools that help write them.\nYou can try Regexr or Regex101 to help write regexes and get helpful information about what is happening in the regular expression.\n\nThe first screenshot is the regex we are entering and the test string we are testing against.\nRegular Expression:\n(##)(\\s+)(\\[)(\\])(\\(.*?\\))([^^]+)\n\nTest String:\n## [](https://google.com)google\nThe Regex101 online tool has a great feature of color coding each capture group for us and we can see each capture group in this example in the right side of the screen.\n\nHere we have 6 Capture Groups:\n\n1st Capturing Group (##)\n2nd Capturing Group (\\s+)\n\\s+ matches any whitespace character (equal to [\\r\\n\\t\\f\\v ])\n\n\n3rd Capturing Group ([)\n[ matches the character [ literally (case sensitive)\n\n\n4th Capturing Group (])\n] matches the character ] literally (case sensitive)\n\n\n5th Capturing Group ((.*?))\n( matches the character ( literally (case sensitive)\n.*? matches any character (except for line terminators)\n*?

for delimiters instead of / which is the default to make it easier for the capture groups.\nThe final options of gp will globally apply to all occurrences and then print the captured group since we suppressed the default action of sed which is to print everything to standard output.\nBring Power of Find and Replace in Command Line\nNow that we have verified what we want out of each command we can assemble the following command:\nfind . -name '*.txt' -exec gsed -Ei.bak 's;(##)(\\s+)(\\[)(\\])(\\(.*?\\))([^^]+);\\1\\2\\3\\6\\4\\5;gp' '{}' \\;\n\nNote that we added -exec for the find action to take and then added '{}' and \\;\nNotice that the braces are enclosed in single quote marks to protect them from interpretation as shell script punctuation. \nThe semicolon is similarly protected by the use of a backslash, though single quotes could have been used in that case also.\nWe also removed the -n option as it has an unintended consequence of removing the contents of the rest of the file.\nWe used it in the command line to see only what we captured but in the context of this command we want it to run for each command.\nIt is important to note that we created a back up file with the -i.bak option just in case an issue occurred and to save us with a backup for problems with our command.\nAdvanced Find and Replace Patterns\nTypically with find and replace patterns you will want to do to check that sed is finding the pattern that you want to replace.\nA trick with sed is to always write out all the delimiters before you start the find:\nsed 's///g' and then go back and enter the text replacement\nLet us say that we want to globally replace the following text here is\nNow with sed: \nsed 's/here is/there we go/g'\nWe can place multiple commands by placing a ; in between like this:\nsed 's/here is/there we go/g;s/to much/too little/g'\nYou can virtually do as many commands in one sed expression as you want by doing this pattern.\nOne thing to note is that you should experiment with sed on one file and then do this next step for global search and replace\nNow using find we can look for all the dat files and do a global find and replace like this:\nfind . -name \"*.dat\" -exec sed -i .bak 's/here is/there we go/g;s/to much/too little/g' {} \\;\nThis command will look at current directory and every subdirectory and then execute the sed command(s) and do an edit and create a bak file that has the original text\nwe can look at the text that is changed with the grep command: \n> grep -nr \"there we go\" .\n./data/otherText.dat:1:there we go the man\n\nBy doing this we can make sure that we get the text change like we expect and once we are confident we can delete the bak files like this\nfind . -name \"*.bak\" -exec rm {} +\nNotice that with find and the -exec option we did this pattern {} \\; and this pattern {} + this works as a placeholder for each file/folder\nIf you are doubly sure that your global find and replace works you can do this change to do an in place file edit with sed:\nfind . -name \"*.dat\" -exec sed -i '' 's/here is/there we go/g;s/to much/too little/g' {} \\;\nNotice here that we didn’t specify a file to backup with so sed just edits the file and doesn’t create any backup, the '' is necessary on mac os x, in linux you can probably get away without doing it.\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Shell Security\nSystem Administration Commands →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/system-administration-commands.html":{"url":"docs/system-administration-commands.html","title":"System Administration Commands","keywords":"","body":"Unix Programming and Regular Expressions Workshop - System Administration Commands\nSections:\n\nMemory Usage Commands\nfree command description\nfree command options\nfree command examples\nRead /proc/meminfo stats\nvmstat command description\nvmstat command options\nvmstat command examples\n\n\nProcess Information Commands\ntop|htop command description\ntop|htop command options\ntop|htop command examples\nps command description\nps command options\nps command examples\n\n\nEnvironment Variable Commands\nprintenv command description\nprintenv command options\nprintenv command examples\nenv command description\nenv command options\nenv command examples\n\n\nDisk Usage Commands\ndf command description\ndf command options\ndf command examples\ndu command description\ndu command options\ndu command examples\nstat command description\nstat command options\nstat command examples\nfdisk command description\nfdisk command options\nfdisk command examples\n\n\nNetwork Commands\nifconfig command description\nifconfig command options\nifconfig command examples\ntraceroute command description\ntraceroute command options\ntraceroute command examples\ndig command description\ndig command options\ndig command examples\ntelnet command description\ntelnet command options\ntelnet command examples\n\n\nFileSystem Commands\n\nmount|unmount command description\nmount|unmount command options\nmount|unmount command examples\nfstab command description\nfstab file example\ntune2fs command description\ntune2fs command options\ntune2fs command examples\n\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\nMemory Usage Commands\nThere are several commands you can use in Unix/Linux for to check memory usage:\n\nfree\nvmstats\n\nIt is important to  check memory usage and memory used per process on a server that way resources do not fall short and users are able to access the server.\nFor example a webserver must have enough memory to serve the traffic or else the website can become slow and in extreme traffic spike situations go down.\nfree command description\nfree - Display amount of free and used memory in the system\nfree  displays  the  total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system, as well as the buffers and caches used by the kernel. \nThe information is gathered by parsing /proc/meminfo. \nThe displayed columns are:\n\ntotal  \n\nTotal installed memory (MemTotal and SwapTotal in /proc/meminfo)\n\n\nused   \n\nUsed memory (calculated as total - free - buffers - cache)\n\n\nfree   \n\nUnused memory (MemFree and SwapFree in /proc/meminfo)\n\n\nshared \n\nMemory used (mostly) by tmpfs (Shmem in /proc/meminfo)\n\n\nbuffers\n\nMemory used by kernel buffers (Buffers in /proc/meminfo)\n\n\ncache  \n\nMemory used by the page cache and slabs (Cached and SReclaimable in /proc/meminfo)\n\n\nbuff/cache\n\nSum of buffers and cache\n\n\navailable\n\nEstimation of how much memory is available for starting new applications, without swapping.\n\n\n\nfree command options\nList of free command options:\n\n-b, --bytes\n\nDisplay the amount of memory in bytes.\n\n\n-k, --kibi\n\nDisplay the amount of memory in kibibytes.

This division is recorded in  the  partition  table,\nusually found in sector 0 of the disk.  (In the BSD world one talks about disk slices' and adisklabel'.)\nAll  partitioning is driven by device I/O limits (the topology) by default.  fdisk is able to optimize the disk layout for a 4K-sec‐\ntor size and use an alignment offset on modern devices for MBR and GPT.  It is always a good idea to follow fdisk's defaults as  the\ndefault  values  (e.g.  first  and last partition sectors) and partition sizes specified by the >size\nfdisk command options\nList of fdisk command options:\n\n-b, --sector-size sectorsize\n\nSpecify the sector size of the disk.  Valid values are 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096.  (Recent kernels know the sector size.  \nUse this option only on old kernels or to override the kernel's ideas.)  \nSince util-linux-2.17, fdisk differentiates between logical and physical sector size.  \nThis option changes both sector sizes to sectorsize.\n\n\n-B, --protect-boot\n\nDon't erase the begin of the first disk sector when create a new disk label.  \nThis feature is supported for GPT and MBR.\n\n\n-c, --compatibility[=mode]\n\nSpecify  the compatibility mode, 'dos' or 'nondos'.  The default is non-DOS mode. \n\n\n-h, --help\n\nDisplay a help text and exit.\n\n\n-L, --color[=when]\n\nColorize  the output.  The optional argument when can be auto, never or always.  \nIf the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.  The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see the --help output. \n\n\n\nRead the Fine Manual for more options\nat fdisk man page\nfdisk command examples\nView all Disk Partitions in Linux\n> sudo su -\n> fdisk -l\nDisk /dev/xvda: 8 GiB, 8589934592 bytes, 16777216 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0x242113bb\n\nDevice     Boot Start      End  Sectors Size Id Type\n/dev/xvda1 *     2048 16777215 16775168   8G 83 Linux\n\nView Specific Disk Partition in Linux\nfdisk -l /dev/xvda\nDisk /dev/xvda: 8 GiB, 8589934592 bytes, 16777216 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0x242113bb\n\nDevice     Boot Start      End  Sectors Size Id Type\n/dev/xvda1 *     2048 16777215 16775168   8G 83 Linux\n\nCheck all Available fdisk Commands\nfdisk /dev/xvda\n\nWelcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.29.2).\nChanges will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.\nBe careful before using the write command.\n\n\nCommand (m for help): m\n\nHelp:\n\n  DOS (MBR)\n   a   toggle a bootable flag\n   b   edit nested BSD disklabel\n   c   toggle the dos compatibility flag\n\n  Generic\n   d   delete a partition\n   F   list free unpartitioned space\n   l   list known partition types\n   n   add a new partition\n   p   print the partition table\n   t   change a partition type\n   v   verify the partition table\n   i   print information about a partition\n\n  Misc\n   m   print this menu\n   u   change display/entry units\n   x   extra functionality (experts only)\n\n  Script\n   I   load disk layout from sfdisk script file\n   O   dump disk layout to sfdisk script file\n\n  Save & Exit\n   w   write table to disk and exit\n   q   quit without saving changes\n\n  Create a new label\n   g   create a new empty GPT partition table\n   G   create a new empty SGI (IRIX) partition table\n   o   create a new empty DOS partition table\n   s   create a new empty Sun partition table\n\nNetwork Commands\n\nNetwork computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes.[1] Nodes are generally identified by network addresses, and can include hosts such as personal computers, phones, and servers, as well as networking hardware such as routers and switches. Two such devices can be said to be networked together when one device is able to exchange information with the other device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other. In most cases, application-specific communications protocols are layered (i.e. carried as payload) over other more general communications protocols. This formidable collection of information technology requires skilled network management to keep it all running reliably.\n\nifconfig command description\nifconfig - configure a network interface\nIfconfig  is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces.

The mount command serves to attach the filesystem found on some device to  the  big  file  tree.   \nConversely, the umount command will detach it again.\numount description\numount - unmount file systems\nThe umount command detaches the mentioned file system(s) from the file hierarchy.  A file system is specified by giving the directory where it has been mounted.  \nGiving the special device on which the file system lives may also work, but is  obsolete,  mainly because it will fail in case this device was mounted on more than one directory.\nmount|unmount command options\nList of mount command options:\n\n-a, --all\n\nMount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in fstab (except for those whose line contains  the  noauto  keyword). The filesystems are mounted following their order in fstab.\n\nNote that it is a bad practice to use mount -a for fstab checking. The recommended solution is findmnt --verify.\n\n\n\n-B, --bind\n\nRemount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are available in both places).  See above, under Bind mounts.\n\n\n-c, --no-canonicalize\n\nDon't  canonicalize paths.  The mount command canonicalizes all paths (from command line or fstab) by default.  This option\ncan be used together with the -f flag for already canonicalized absolute paths.  The option is designed for  mount  helpers\nwhich call mount -i.  It is strongly recommended to not use this command-line option for normal mount operations.\n\n\n-F, --fork\n  (Used  in conjunction with -a.)  Fork off a new incarnation of mount for each device.  This will do the mounts on different\n  devices or different NFS servers in parallel.  This has the advantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts go in  parallel.\n  A  disadvantage is that the mounts are done in undefined order.  Thus, you cannot use this option if you want to mount both\n  /usr and /usr/spool.\n\n-f, --fake\n  Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; if it's not obvious, this ``fakes'' mounting  the  filesys‐\n  tem.   This  option  is useful in conjunction with the -v flag to determine what the mount command is trying to do.  It can\n  also be used to add entries for devices that were mounted earlier with the -n option.  The -f option checks for an existing\n  record in /etc/mtab and fails when the record already exists (with a regular non-fake mount, this check is done by the ker‐\n  nel).\n\n\nRead the Fine Manual for more options\nat mount man page\nmount|umount command examples\nShow mounted drives\n> mount\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\nudev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,nosuid,relatime,size=498244k,nr_inodes=124561,mode=755)\ndevpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000)\ntmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,size=101848k,mode=755)\n/dev/xvda1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,discard,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)\nsecurityfs on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\ntmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)\ntmpfs on /run/lock type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=5120k)\ntmpfs on /sys/fs/cgroup type tmpfs (ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=755)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,xattr,release_agent=/lib/systemd/systemd-cgroups-agent,name=systemd)\npstore on /sys/fs/pstore type pstore (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,perf_event)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls,net_prio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,net_cls,net_prio)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpu,cpuacct)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,blkio)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,freezer)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/devices type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,devices)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/memory type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,memory)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpuset)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/pids type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,pids)\nsystemd-1 on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=28,pgrp=1,timeout=0,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=9476)\nhugetlbfs on /dev/hugepages type hugetlbfs (rw,relatime)\nmqueue on /dev/mqueue type mqueue (rw,relatime)\ndebugfs on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw,relatime)\ntmpfs on /run/user/1000 type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,size=101844k,mode=700,uid=1000,gid=1000)\n\nMount a new folder to a device\nmkdir /data\nmount /dev/xvda1 /data\n\nThen we can grep to see this new mount point like this:\nmount | grep \"xvda1\"\n/dev/xvda1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,discard,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)\n/dev/xvda1 on /data type ext4 (rw,relatime,discard,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)\n\nUnmount new mounted drive\n> umount /dev/xvda1\n> mount | grep \"xvda1\"\n/dev/xvda1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,discard,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)\n\nNotice that now the mount does not have /data mount anymore\nfstab command description\nfstab - static information about the filesystems\nThe  file fstab contains descriptive information about the filesystems the system can mount.  \nfstab is only read by programs, and not written; it is the duty of the system administrator to properly create and maintain this file.  \nThe order of records in  fstab is important because fsck, mount, and umount sequentially iterate through fstab doing their thing.\nRead the Fine Manual for more options\nat fstab man page\nfstab file example\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n#                     \n\n# device during installation: /dev/loop0p1\nUUID=1d1c745e-7ded-4d3a-8c53-236b2793db16    /    ext4    rw,discard,errors=remount-ro    0    1\n\ntune2fs command description\ntune2fs - adjust tunable filesystem parameters on ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems\ntune2fs allows the system administrator to adjust various tunable filesystem parameters on Linux ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystems.\nThe current values of these options can be displayed by using the -l option to tune2fs program, or by using the dumpe2fs program.\ntune2fs command options\nList of tune2fs command options:\n\n-c max-mount-counts\n\nAdjust the number of mounts after which the filesystem will be checked by e2fsck(8).
